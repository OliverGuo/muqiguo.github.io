In this study, we report on a national evaluation of the nature and availability of child sexual abuse prevention programs delivered in Australian primary schools. A survey instrument, anchored in empirical evidence, was distributed to all providers of child sexual abuse prevention programs in Australian primary schools serving children aged 4 to 13 years. Respondents were program coordinators or facilitators who provided data on 35 school-based child sexual abuse prevention programs that reached 631,720 children (approximately 26% of the Australian primary school student population) in 1 year. On average, each program reached 18,049 children in a calendar year (ranging from 200 to 80,000 children). Median child age for program exposure was 8 years. However, program duration was poorly reported so it was difficult to establish what program dosage was received.

It is important to be aware of the social and individual factors associated with sexual violence to prevent and fight sexual violence. In this study, it was aimed to determine the associations between sexual violence and women�s sexual attitudes, sexual self-consciousness, and sexual self-efficacy. This is a descriptive study. The data were collected from 469 women admitted to three family health centers in Turkey between May and September 2018. Data were collected using a data collection form and three scales (the Sexual Self-Consciousness Scale, the Sexual Self-efficacy Scale, and the Hendrick Brief Sexual Attitudes Scale). The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as the independent-sample t test and logistic regression analysis. It was found that 37.7% of the women were exposed to sexual violence. The most frequent response of the women against sexual violence was �crying� with 61%. The first reason why the women maintained the marriage despite sexual violence was to avoid their children growing up without a father (43.3%). There was a statistically significant difference between sexual violence and sexual 1Faculty of Health Sciences, Sel�uk University, Konya, Turkey Corresponding Author: Hacer Alan Dikmen, Assistant Professor, Department of Midwifery, Faculty of Health Sciences, Sel�uk University, Sel�uklu, 42250 Konya, Turkey.

In Trinidad and Tobago, child sexual abuse was identified as a prevalent behavior. This motivated a gendered exploration of the sociocultural factors underlying child sexual abuse and the link with HIV. Using a qualitative action research methodology, researchers sought to understand the patterns of behavior, sociocultural and gendered meanings, and significance of child sexual abuse; to sensitize stakeholders to these issues; and to develop multidisciplinary community.based interventions and policies. This article reports on the analysis of data collected from the interventions carried out as part of the action research methodology, as well as a range of national and community-specific action research activities including ethnographic case studies, national stakeholders meetings, and a study of service providers. It provides a nuanced understanding of the meanings, underlying assumptions, perceptions, and taboos associated with child sexual abuse in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as new ways of understanding child sexual abuse in the Caribbean.

7,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA#-2020-JHE.txt," Late childhood and adolescence is a critical time for social and emotional development. Over the past two decades, this life stage has been hugely affected by the almost universal adoption of the internet as a source of information, communication, and entertainment. We use a large representative sample of over 6300 children in England over the period 2012–2017, to estimate the effect of neighbourhood broadband speed, as a proxy for inter- net use, on a number of wellbeing outcomes, which reflect how these children feel about different aspects of their life. We find that internet use is negatively associated with well- being across a number of domains. The strongest effect is for how children feel about their appearance, and the effects are worse for girls than boys. We test a number of potential causal mechanisms, and find support both for the ‘crowding out’ hypothesis, whereby inter- net use reduces the time spent on other beneficial activities, and for the adverse effect of social media use. Our evidence adds weight to the already strident calls for interventions that can reduce the adverse effects of internet use on children’s emotional health. © 2019 The Authors.

Four results emerge. First, all indicators show huge uncertainty jumps in reaction to the pandemic and its economic fallout. Indeed, most indicators reach their highest values on record. Second, peak amplitudes differ greatly – from a 35% rise for the model-based measure of US economic uncertainty (relative to January 2020) to a 20-fold rise in forecaster disagreement about UK growth. Third, time paths also differ: Implied volatility rose rapidly from late February, peaked in mid-March, and fell back by late March as stock prices began to recover. In contrast, broader measures of uncertainty peaked later and then plateaued, as job losses mounted, highlighting differences between Wall Street and Main Street uncertainty mea- sures. Fourth, in Cholesky-identified VAR models fit to monthly U.S. data, a COVID-size uncertainty shock fore- shadows peak drops in industrial production of 12–19%.

9,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA#-2021-JHE.txt," We examine the impact of progressive and regressive abortion legislation on women’s health in Mexico. Following a 2007 reform in the Federal District of Mexico which decriminalised and subsidised early-term elective abortion, multiple other Mexican states increased sanctions on illegal abortion. We observe that the original legalisation resulted in a sharp decline in maternal morbidity, particularly morbidity due to haemorrhage early in pregnancy. We observe small or null impacts on women’s health from increasing sanctions on illegal abortion. These results quantify the considerable improvements in non-mortal health outcomes flowing from legal access to abortion. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Hence, reported coefficients show price effects at the extensive margin. The price effect is a 4.8 percentage point decrease in the probability to have a claim in a given month under the no-claim regime and a 7.4 percentage point decrease under the deductible. The difference is statistically different from zero at the 5 percent level. 6.2. Effect heterogeneity Next, we characterize effect heterogeneity. We do so to investigate whether the average effects we estimate are driven by particular groups or whether framing has an effect across all groups. For this we leverage the fact that our sample is for a broad sample of the population and that we observe background variables such as income in the neighborhood. Our general approach to characterize effect heterogeneity is to split the sample.32 We start with investigating whether price effects and the impact of framing differ by income. We divide individuals in 4 groups, according to the average income at the 6-digit neighborhood level, where quartile 1 refers to the group with the lowest income. A 6-digit postal code has on average 37 residents (footnote 16). Table 3 shows that that individuals in poorer neighborhoods do not react more strongly to cost-sharing incentives 32 Here and in the following we present results for the effect on expenditures.

Results for each of the income groups are similar to the baseline results, and there are no systematic differences across groups, with the exemption that individuals in the lowest income quartile react less strongly to cost-sharing incentives under the no-claim refund. Furthermore, within each group the price effect is significantly stronger under a deductible scheme than under a no-claim refund scheme. Yet, the difference between the price effects under a deductible and a no-claim refund is larger for individuals in low income neighborhoods. Table 4 shows results by age and gender. Individuals in all age and gender groups react stronger to deductibles than to no-claim refunds. Moreover, price responses are similar for persons above age 65 and for persons below age 65. This is an interesting result since many previous studies on the effects of patient cost-sharing examine either the working age population or people above age 65, e.g. Medicare beneficiaries. In the Netherlands, individuals buy the same type of health insurance below and above age 65, and insurance coverage does not change discontinuously at age 65, as it does for instance in the U.S. (Card et al., 2008). However, we find differences in price effects on expenditures by gender. Women react stronger to cost-sharing incentives than men, both under a deductible and a no-claim refund. Next, we split the sample by risk score. The idea behind this is that we expect individuals with a higher risk score to react less strongly to price changes. About 80 percent of the individuals with an above-median risk score will exhaust the deductible or no-claim refund limit by the end of the year, while this is the case for only about 20–30 percent of the individuals with a below-median risk score. Therefore, one might expect below-median risk score individuals to react more strongly to hitting the cost-sharing limit, as it is a priori less likely that they do (see Section 3). Table 5 is in line with this prediction. We find that the price effect for individuals with below-median risk scores is generally stronger than for individuals with above-median risk scores. Furthermore, we find that 12 Cardetal.,2008 A.P. Hayen, T.J. Klein and M. Salm Journal of Health Economics 80 (2021) 102520 Fig. 3. Effect of framing on yearly health care expenditures and out-of-pocket payments Notes: This figure shows, for each risk score decile, the simulated effect of framing cost-sharing incentives as a deductible instead of a no-claim refund (dots). Numbers next to the dots are the percentage changes. Absolute values are given on the right axis. The solid line is the effect on out-of-pocket payments. The simulation is done for 2015.. the difference between the price effects under a deductible and a no-claim refund is larger for individuals with a high risk score, and this difference is very small and not statistically significant for individuals with a low risk score. 6.3. The effect of framing on annual health care expenditures Our main results so far are that no-claim refunds and deductibles reduce monthly health care expenditures by 16.9 percent and 38.7 percent, respectively, in months in which patients are still subject to cost-sharing. Yet, these numbers are not indicative for the effects of no-claim refunds and deductibles on annual health care expenditures since cost-sharing incentives apply only for months in which cost-sharing limits are not yet exceeded. In this section we aim to compute the effect of no-claim refunds and deductibles on annual health care expenditures and on annual out-of-pocket spending. For this, we conduct a simulation study. In a first step, we calculate the residuals and estimate their empirical distribution function. Then, we take our estimation equation and a current price of 1 at the beginning of January as a starting point and simulate, for each individual in our data set, health care expenditures in January by calculating the predicted mean of the log of health care expenditures plus one, according to equation (1), and adding a draw from the empirical distribution function of the residual. This is then transformed into actual health care expenditures by applying the exponential function and subtracting 1. Next, we calculate simulated prices for all individuals at the beginning of February, again predict the mean of the log of health care spending plus one given those prices, and so on. We do so for 2015 and both the case in which cost-sharing incentives are framed as a deductible, as it was the case in 2015, and for the case in which cost-sharing incentives are framed as a no-claim refund. For the latter, we use 𝛽no-claim refund instead of 𝛽deductible. Fig. 3 shows the result. On average, annual health care expenditures are 8.6 percent lower when cost-sharing incentives are framed as a deductible than when they are framed as a no-claim refund. In absolute terms, annual health care expenditures decrease more for higher risk score deciles. In relative terms, annual care expenditures decrease more for lower risk-score deciles. The underlying mechanism is that low risk-score individuals tend to exceed cost-sharing limits later in the year or not at all, and they are thus subject to cost-sharing incentives for a longer period than high risk-score individuals. Turning to the effect of the framing of cost-sharing incentives on out-of-pocket spending, we find that it follows a U-shaped pattern. The effect is lowest for individuals with a high risk score. For individuals who exceed the cost-sharing limit under both cost-sharing schemes there is no difference in out-of-pocket spending between the two schemes. The effect is also small for individuals with the lowest risk-scores. These individuals have low health care expenditures and low out-of-pocket spending under both schemes. The effect of framing on out-of-pocket spending is largest for individuals in risk-score deciles 5 and 6. Overall, it is striking that changing the framing of cost-sharing incentives leads to large effects on health care spending—a reduction of 207.97 euros per year on average—, while having very modest effects—a reduction of 10.06 euros on average—on out-of-pocket expenditures. 7. Potential mechanisms In the previous section we have shown that individuals react more strongly to financial incentives in years in which they are framed as a deductible than in years in which they are framed as a no-claim refund. In this section, we present possible explanations for our findings, including loss aversion, time discounting, liquidity constraints, differences in information, and salience. We conclude that loss aversion is our preferred explanation, but we cannot completely rule out other explanations such as time discounting, liquidity constraints, and salience. 13 Fig.3 A.P. Hayen, T.J. Klein and M. Salm Journal of Health Economics 80 (2021) 102520 Fig. 4. Experienced effects Notes: This figure shows the experienced effects of a foregone refund and of a deductible payment. The amount for both is the same.. 7.1. Loss aversion Loss aversion, one of the elements of prospect theory, postulates that decision-makers value losses more than corresponding gains (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). This concept can also be applied to patient cost-sharing for health insurance where cost-sharing incentives can be perceived either as a loss or a gain. Whether patients perceive payments as a loss or a gain depends on their reference point. In a theoretical contribution, Johnson et al. (1993) consider the case when patients perceive their financial situation after paying insurance premiums as reference point.33 Compared to this reference point they will view a deductible payment as a loss. In contrast, if they receive a refund at the end of the year under a no-claim refund policy, then they will view this payment as a gain relative to their reference point. Thus, patients should react stronger to cost-sharing under a deductible policy than under a no-claim refund policy. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, which shows a utility curve (“value”) under loss aversion when the cost-sharing limit has not been reached. The reference point is the financial situation after paying health insurance premiums. The utility curve is steeper to the left than to the right of the cutoff point, and in both directions the utility curve becomes flatter with increasing distance to the reference point. The figure shows that the experienced effect of a deductible payment is higher than the effect of an equivalent reduction in the refund under a no-claim refund policy. When patients make decisions about medical care use they will compare the value of the treatment with the value they assign to their own payment, either a deductible payment or a foregone refund under a no-claim refund policy. Thus, patients will use less medical care under a deductible policy than under a no-claim refund policy.34 Above, we have assumed that patients perceive the financial situation after paying health insurance premiums as their reference point. However, van Winssen et al. (2016) point out that individuals may also have other reference points such as their financial situation before paying insurance premiums. In that case, they will feel to be in the loss domain under both schemes. Then, there will be no stronger response to the price under a deductible than under a no-claim refund. Our findings show that patients respond more strongly to incentives when they are framed as deductibles than when they are framed as no-claim refunds. Therefore, our findings are in line with the situation illustrated in Fig. 4, and they are compatible with the explanation that individuals are loss-averse and form their reference point in a way so that they react more strongly to incentives when they are framed in terms of losses instead of gains. This is our preferred explanation. Turning to our analysis for subgroups, Tables 3 and 5 show that the difference in responses to no-claim refunds and deductibles is bigger for individuals with low neighborhood income and high risk score than for individuals with high neighborhood income and low risk score, respectively. These findings could be explained if persons with low neighborhood income and high risk score are more loss averse than other groups in the population. 7.2. Timing of payments An alternative explanation for our findings is that deductibles and no-claim refunds differ not only in the framing of cost-sharing incentives, but also in the timing of payments. This raises the question whether the difference in the timing of payments could explain our results. The timing of payments can matter for at least two reasons: time preferences and liquidity constraints. Patients might prefer later payments to earlier ones, and they might find it hard to raise money on short notice to make an out-of-pocket payment. 33 This is the situation we have depicted in Fig. 1. 34 In our empirical analysis, for reasons we have given in Section 3, we study the reaction to current prices. The analysis is carried out on a monthly level. The reasoning in the paragraph above also applies to the monthly level: Fig. 4 then shows utility defined over gains and losses at the monthly level, when the reference point is wealth after the monthly premium has been paid. 14 KahnemanandTversky,1979Johnsonetal.(1993)Fig.4vanWinssenetal.(2016)Fig.4Fig.4 A.P.

Standard errors are clustered at the risk score decile- gender-age group-year level. ∗ 𝑝 < .10, ∗∗ 𝑝 < .05, ∗∗∗ 𝑝 < .01. In general, the no-claim refund is paid out only at the end of the first quarter of the following year, whereas deductibles have to be paid several weeks or months after the treatment. As explained in Section 2.3, there is a substantial delay between the time of the treatment and the time at which the deductible payment is due. Figure C.1 in the Online Appendix shows that the average delay between the treatment and the billing date from the health care provider to the insurance company is about 3.5 months. This is a lower bound, because there is an additional delay before the insurer sends an invoice to the patient and because the payment is not immediately due. Moreover, patients have the possibility to arrange with the health insurer to pay in installments.35 Can time preferences explain our findings? To find out how much discounting we would need to explain our findings, we first assume exponential discounting and re-do our analysis taking the delay in payments into account. We assume a high, but still plausible annual discount rate of 10 percent, and we allow for compounding within the year. Based on Figure C.1 in the Online Appendix, we further assume a delay of 3.5 months under the deductible regime, corresponding to the deductible payment being due at the end of the third month after the treatment. For the no-claim refund, we assume that the delay is 3.5 months in December, 4.5 months in November, and so on, because the no-claim refund is paid out at the end of the first quarter in the following year. Making these assumptions allows us to re-compute current prices and thus take the difference in timing into account. In particular, we set the current price to (1∕(1 + 0.1))𝑚∕12 for payments 𝑚 months in the future. Results are presented in Table 6. They are very similar to our main results presented in Table 2. Thus, exponential discounting at a 10 percent rate is not enough to explain our findings. Second, we use a stylized model to compute which discount rate would be high enough to explain the difference in effects between deductibles and no-claim refunds that we find. Online Appendix B contains details of our calculations. We find that the annualized discount rate would need to be higher than 400% to explain our results. We consider this discount rate to be implausibly large.36 Therefore, we believe that impatience alone cannot fully explain our findings. Turning to liquidity constraints as a potential explanation, it follows from the institutional setup that deductible payments are usually due with a substantial delay and that it is possible to pay in installments. This makes it less likely that liquidity constraints are important. Moreover, we find in our analysis that the reaction to deductibles does not differ by neighborhood income. Together, this suggests that also liquidity constraints cannot fully explain our results. However, we also cannot exclude that impatience and liquidity constraints explain at least some of our findings. One reason is that patients might perceive deductible payments as immediate even though they are not. If in addition they are also present-biased, then this could partly explain the very high discount rates we compute. Moreover, our finding that there is no difference in the response to deductibles by neighborhood income does not necessarily imply that liquidity constraints play no role. There is evidence that even among the wealthy there are people who are liquidity constrained or act as if they were (Ericson and Sydnor, 2018; Kaplan and Violante, 2014; Olafsson and Pagel, 2018). 35 The share of insurees (>18 years of age), who indicated having problems paying the deductible bill (and small co-payments), and with whom the health insurer worked out some form of payment plan fluctuated between 2% and 10% across years (2011: 2%, 2012: 2%, 2013: 4%, 2014: 10%, 2015: 7%; source: undisclosed health insurer from which we have the data). 36 In Online Appendix B we show that this conclusion does not hinge on the assumption of exponential discounting. 15 EricsonandSydnor,2018KaplanandViolante,2014OlafssonandPagel,2018 A.P. Hayen, T.J. Klein and M. Salm Journal of Health Economics 80 (2021) 102520 7.3. The role of information Another possible explanation why individuals react stronger to deductibles than to no-claim refunds is that they are better informed about economic incentives under a deductible policy than under a no-claim refund policy. This can be the case if they are either better informed about the policy rules or better informed about the price of care at a given point of time under a deductible policy. Yet, as discussed in Section 2.4 knowledge about both no-claim refunds and deductibles was almost universal in the Dutch pop- ulation throughout our study period with the exception of the year 2008 immediately after the introduction of the deductible. Also, the way people were informed about whether they were above or below the cost sharing limit was similar under the no-claim refund policy and the deductible policy. 7.4. Salience A further possible explanation for different responses to no-claim refunds and deductibles could be related to the salience of cost- sharing incentives. Salience can be defined as “the phenomenon that when one’s attention is differentially directed to one portion of the environment rather than to others, the information contained in that portion will receive disproportionate weighting in subsequent judgements” (Taylor and Thompson, 1982). In the context of cost-sharing, Dalton et al. (2020) find that strong responses to spot prices, as opposed to expected end-of-year prices, can be attributed to the greater salience of spot prices. In contrast, we compare the response to spot prices under a deductible policy to the response to spot prices under a no-claim refund. Our results could be explained by salience if more attention is drawn to cost-sharing incentives under a deductible than under a no-claim refund. However, it is not clear why this should be the case in the Dutch institutional setting. Neither the no-claim refund nor the deductible result in immediate payments at the time of treatment. Also, the information individuals receive about cost-sharing incentives is comparable between the two cost-sharing schemes (see Section 2.4). While these factors point against salience as an explanation for our findings, we cannot completely rule it out. 8. Validity of instruments and sensitivity analysis In this section, we first assess whether the instruments we use are relevant. Then, we present results from a placebo test in order to assess the credibility of our empirical approach. Next, we examine whether our results are driven by variation in the size of the cost-sharing limit and changes in the basic health insurance plan across years. After this, we present results for a number of robustness checks for alternative specifications of explanatory variables and outcome variables, and we examine whether our results are sensitive to changes in the sample composition over time. Here, we also ask whether end-of-the-year effects could explain our results. All tables are presented in the Online Appendix. 8.1. Instrument validity One of the conditions for an instrument to be valid is that the instrument must be related to the endogenous variable conditional on controls. Table C.2 shows that the simulated average price at the group level is highly predictive of the individual price 𝑝𝑖𝑡. The relevant 𝐹 -statistics are extremely high. They are 1,216 and 8,046, respectively. Turning to the exclusion restriction, one way to assess the credibility of our empirical approach is to perform a placebo test. In the Netherlands children below the age of 18 are not subject to patient cost-sharing. For this reason, our main analysis was conducted for a sample of individuals at ages 19 and above.37 If we apply our empirical approach to a sample of individuals between ages 15 and 17 and code the price as if they were actually subject to cost sharing, then we should not find any effect. And indeed, Table C.3 shows that price effects are not significantly different from zero for this group and also not significantly different from one another. Thus, our empirical approach performs well in a setting where we know that the true parameters are zero.38 8.2. Variation in cost-sharing limits across years The cost-sharing limit for the no-claim refund of 255 euros in 2007 was substantially higher than the cost-sharing limits in the first years after introducing the deductible, which started at 150 euros in 2008. In our empirical approach, we examine how medical spending depends on 𝑝𝑖𝑡, the price of the first unit of care in a given month. The computation of 𝑝𝑖𝑡 takes different cost-sharing limits across years into account since it depends on whether or not patients have exceeded their relevant cost-sharing limit at a given point of time. In our estimation equation, we also control for year dummies and the expected end-of-year price at the group level. However, it is nevertheless possible that the response to 𝑝𝑖𝑡 depends on the cost-sharing limit. For instance, patients might react more strongly to 𝑝𝑖𝑡 in years in which the cost-sharing limit is higher. To investigate this, we estimate the effect of 𝑝𝑖𝑡 on medical spending separately for each year. Our empirical approach, described in Section 5, can also be applied to individual years. Figure C.7 shows the results. For the no-claim refund there is only one year of 37 We did not include 18 year old individuals because we only observe the birth year and not the month of birth. 38 The standard errors for minors (the first column of Table C.3) are about 3 times larger than the ones for our main results (first column of Table 2). This can mostly be explained by a smaller sample size, and it limits the power of the placebo test. 16 TaylorandThompson,1982Daltonetal.(2020) A.P. Hayen, T.J. Klein and M. Salm Journal of Health Economics 80 (2021) 102520 data. But for the deductible there was variation in the cost-sharing limit between 155 euros in the year 2009 and 375 euros in the year 2015. If patients react more strongly to 𝑝𝑖𝑡 in years in which the cost-sharing limit is higher, one might expect that the reaction to the current price becomes stronger over time. However, Figure C.7 shows that the effect of 𝑝𝑖𝑡 on medical spending is very similar throughout the years when the deductible was in place.39 Overall, this suggests that the effect of 𝑝𝑖𝑡 on medical spending does not depend on the cost-sharing limit. 8.3. Sensitivity analysis Next, we conducted a number of additional robustness checks. We first examine whether or not our estimation results are sensitive to different specifications of the covariates in 𝑥𝑖𝑡. These results are shown in Table C.4. Recall that in our baseline specifications 𝑥𝑖𝑡 includes variables for 5 year age brackets, gender, year and month dummies, indicators for the decile of the risk score, the future price in January, and the log of expenditure in the previous 3 months plus 1. In the first column of Table C.4 we use a specification with a full set of risk score-year interactions and a full set of year-month interactions. The results are similar to the baseline results presented in Table 2, suggesting that a specification that is not fully-interacted in this way is general enough. For the second column we include 6 lags of the log of the respective monthly expenditure plus 1 instead of the log of the expenditure in the previous three months plus 1. Results are qualitatively similar as well. In the last column, we use the baseline specification but do not control for the expected price at the end of the year. This again leads to qualitatively similar results, but now the magnitude of the estimated effects is higher. Thus, we find that our main finding that the price effect is more negative under a deductible than under a no-claim refund is robust to using different specifications of explanatory variables. Next, we examine whether or not our estimation results are sensitive to the specification of the outcome variable. Recall that up to now, we have used the log of expenditures plus 1. If we instead use the log of expenditures plus 0.1 or plus 10, then coefficients will be rescaled.40 Table C.5 shows that indeed, adding 0.1 and 10 instead of 1 leads to different estimates—as could be expected. But importantly, the main finding remains unchanged: the price effect is more negative under a deductible than under a no-claim refund. Table C.5 also shows that estimation results remain essentially unchanged when we change the definition of health care expenditure and exclude expenditures on mental health care and geriatric care. These were included in the basic health insurance plan only in later years. Next, we investigate whether results are different for different definitions of our sample. Results are shown in Table C.6. In column (1) we restrict the sample period to one year before and after the change from a no-claim refund to a deductible, respectively, by using data for the years 2007 and 2009 only. We have excluded data from the year 2008, because in 2008 we would use data from 2007 to construct control variables and many patients were not yet aware of the policy change. By excluding data from 2008, we have a cleaner separation between the period in which the no-claim refund was in place and the period in which there was a deductible. Results are similar to our main results for all years. In column (2) we show results for a balanced sample of individuals who are in our sample in all years from 2006 until 2015. In this way, we assess whether our results are sensitive to changes in the sample composition over time during our study period. Results for the balanced sample are similar to the baseline results for the full sample. Our final robustness check concerns the shifting of health care expenditures across years (Cabral, 2016). For some types of health care, individuals can influence the timing of treatment. For example, they can choose whether they will receive a cataract surgery now or some months later. Individuals who have exceeded their cost-sharing limit in the current year have an incentive to shift treatments from the next year to the current year, because at the start of the new year patient cost-sharing limits will be reset. For those patients, the price of care in the current year is zero, but the price of care at the beginning of the next year is one. To see whether the shifting of care between years has an impact on our estimation results we estimate a model that in addition to the other covariates also includes an interaction term between the price 𝑝𝑖𝑡 an indicator for the month of December. The results presented in the first column of Table C.7 show that this does not substantially change the coefficients for the price effects under the two cost-sharing schemes. Interestingly, however, individuals do seem to be more sensitive to the price of care in December than in other months, as one would expect. In the second column we do not use data for December and find results that are very similar to the ones presented in the first column and to our baseline estimates. 9. Conclusions In this study we compare the effects of patient cost-sharing incentives on health care expenditures under a deductible policy and a no-claim refund policy. We estimate that average annual health care expenditures are about 8.6 percent lower under a deductible policy than under a no-claims refund policy, as patients react more strongly to deductibles than to no-claim refunds. 39 There is one exemption to this. In the first year in which the deductible was in place, the effect was comparable to the effect of the no-claim refund. As explained in Section 2.4, in 2008 only 42% of respondents to a representative survey knew about the deductible. One year later this share increased to 95%. 40 For a simple example suppose that there is a claim with probability 0.4 under no cost-sharing and that the claim size is 50 conditional on there being a claim. Assume that the price effect of cost-sharing is a reduction in the probability that there is a claim by 10 percentage points and a reduction in the claim size by 50 percent once there is a claim. Then, the difference between the expected log of expenditure plus 1 under no cost-sharing and the expected log of expenditure plus 1 under cost-sharing is −0.33. If we use respectively 0.1 and 10 instead of 1, then we arrive at −0.42 and −0.23. This shows that the constant one adds will matter. The estimated effect will tentatively be smaller in magnitude if we add a bigger number, at least in this example. 17 Cabral,2016 A.P. Hayen, T.J. Klein and M. Salm Journal of Health Economics 80 (2021) 102520 Our preferred explanation for these results is that individuals are loss-averse and respond differently to both schemes since they perceive a deductible payment as a loss and a no-claim refund as a gain. We also discuss alternative explanations such as time discounting, liquidity constraints, the role of information, and salience. Based on additional empirical evidence and in light of the institutional details we conclude that these alternative explanations are less likely to explain our findings. Our finding that the framing of incentives can have a large and economically important effect on health care expenditures is directly relevant for designing patient cost-sharing schemes. For example, some Dutch health insurers have recently started to offer insurance contracts that allow insurees to pre-pay their deductibles in monthly installments. For these contracts, individuals receive a refund at the end of the year if they have not exceeded their deductible limit, effectively turning the deductible into a no-claim refund. Within a short period around 800,000 insurees have signed up for this scheme. If patients who pay their deductible in monthly installments behave similar to patients under a no-claim refund then our simulation results predict that total annual health care expenditures are around 8.6 percent higher than under a standard deductible. In their calculation of insurance premiums Dutch health insurers do not take this behavioral effect into account. Thus, offering the seemingly innocent option to pre-pay deductibles in monthly installments might cause substantial losses for insurers and lead to an increase in health care costs. More generally, our results suggest that discussions on the optimal design of cost-sharing incentives should not only focus on coinsurance rates and cost-sharing limits, but they should also revolve around the question how these are presented to patients.

We exploit county-level rainfall on the last weekend before statewide lockdown in the early phase of the pandemic. After controlling for historical rainfall, temperature, and state fixed-effects, current rainfall is a plausibly exogenous instrument for so- cial distancing. A one percent decrease in the population leaving home on the weekend before lockdown creates an average of 132 dollars of benefit per county resident within 2 weeks. The impacts of earlier distancing compound over time and mainly arise from lowering the risk of a major outbreak, yielding large but unevenly distributed social benefit. "

Results show large nega- tive effects across many dimensions. Due to COVID-19: 13% of students have delayed graduation, 40% have lost a job, internship, or job offer, and 29% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly het- erogeneous. One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4 hours per week due to COVID-19, while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This heterogeneity often followed existing socioeconomic divides. Lower-income students are 55% more likely than their higher-income peers to have delayed graduation due to COVID-19. Finally, we show that the economic and health related shocks induced by COVID-19 vary systematically by socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining the large (and heterogeneous) effects of the pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

14,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA01-2021-AJPS.txt," Increasing ideological polarization and dysfunction in Congress raise questions about whether and how Congress remains capable of constraining the activities of other actors in the separation of powers system. In this article, I argue Congress uses nonstatutory policymaking tools to overcome the burdens of legislative gridlock in an increasingly polarized time to constrain executive branch actors. I leverage a new data set of committee reports issued by the House and Senate appropriations committees from fiscal years 1923 through 2019 to empirically explore these dynamics and evaluate my argument. Traditionally, these reports are a primary vehicle through which Congress directs agency policymaking in the appropriations process. Committees increasingly turn to them when passing legislation is most difficult and interbranch agency problems are most pronounced. In this way, nonstatutory mechanisms may help maintain the balance of power across branches, even when Congress faces gridlock-induced incapacity. Separation of powers is central to American governance. Although theoretically this structure allows citizens to reap the salutary benefits of institutional actors checking the actions of others, it also embeds gridlock into the foundation of U.S. politics, which can lead to policy stasis. When legislators have fragmented preferences, this legislative incapacity will be more severe and prevent the government from passing laws to address pressing social and economic issues (see Barber and McCarty 2015, for an overview of this literature). This inability to pass legislation is particularly consequential when Congress wants to direct, check, or counter the unilateral or regulatory policies of the executive. Unless Congress can muster large supermajorities to overcome a presidential veto and overturn an administration's decision, it is seemingly inhibited from preventing and responding to executive actions that leave legislative majorities worse off relative to existing policy (Howell 2003; Krehbiel 1998). Thus, the intrabranch supermajoritarian constraints on passing legislation impair the ability of congressional majorities to influence executive policymaking, particularly in the presence of interbranch preference divergence. Together, gridlock and interbranch agency problems seemingly undermine key principles underlying separation of powers and legislative constraints on executive actions (e.g., Barber and McCarty 2015; Carmines and Fowler 2017). Where does this leave congressional control over the bureaucracy and the executive? On its face, it suggests presidents and their wider administrations have substantial leeway to act, potentially in ways that make Congress worse off. Yet, empirical patterns of executive policymaking suggest agencies and presidents are at least somewhat responsive to congressional preferences, even in recent decades when polarization is high. For instance, presidents appear to decrease their unilateral behavior in the face of congressional opposition and agencies decrease their regulatory output during periods of divided government (Howell 2003; Potter and Shipan 2017; Yackee and Yackee 2009). Indeed, Acs (2019) demonstrates agency regulatory behavior is consistent with a model in which Congress can unilaterally veto regulations, even though legislative vetoes were proscribed by the Supreme Court in INS v. Chadha. Why would executive actors forbear in this way, however, if Congress cannot credibly act to direct or overturn these actions legislatively? I focus on nonstatutory means Congress possesses to direct or discipline the executive branch, that is, policy instruments that influence executive policy choices but are not statutes. I explore the dynamics of nonstatutory control by focusing on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees and their use of reports accompanying their legislation to direct the activities of the executive branch. Traditionally, policy directives to agencies from appropriators appear in this form rather than in statutes. Drawing on the logic of repeated play, I argue agencies have strong incentives to be scrupulous in their adherence to them. Notably, unlike appropriations laws, these reports do not need to be approved by anyone outside the appropriations committee, which makes them a powerful way for appropriators to communicate to agencies about their policy preferences while also skirting collective action issues associated with passing legislation. Although not legally binding like statutes, they may nonetheless preserve congressional influence over executive actions in a gridlocked legislative environment by acting as parallel informal policymaking institutions alongside statutory texts (Azari and Smith 2012). This argument provides clear predictions about when committees rely on these nonstatutory policy instruments to guide agency behavior. First, interbranch agency problems, which arise when Congress and the executive do not share policy and political goals, should impel congressional actors to pursue control over the executive branch. Second, these efforts are increasingly likely to take nonstatutory forms when Congress is highly gridlocked given that nonstatutory tools are not affected in the same way as legislation by gridlock. Importantly, I argue that the impacts of gridlock and interbranch conflict on nonstatutory policymaking are interactive. In the context of the appropriations process, reports will be longer and include more constraints when interbranch conflict and gridlock are both relatively high. When either condition is absent, the effect of the other should be diminished. If there is little gridlock, Congress is better positioned to pursue more binding means than nonstatutory ones for controlling the bureaucracy. If agency problems are minimal, then Congress has less motivation to assert control over the executive branch in the first place. To evaluate this argument, I introduce a data set of appropriations committee reports accompanying annual funding legislation written by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees between fiscal years (FYs) 1923 and 2019. Both gridlock and interbranch agency problems vary considerably over this time period. I examine how the length of these reports and their contents respond to interbranch conflict, gridlock, and their interaction, and find strong support for the theoretical argument. The appropriations committees write substantially longer reports with more constraining provisions when the executive branch is controlled by the opposite party and when gridlock in Congress is relatively high. However, they use these tools less when either condition is absent. These results provide insights into the dynamics of congressional control of the bureaucracy and add to a growing literature about when and why Congress uses nonstatutory means of policy influence (e.g., Lowande 2018; MacDonald and McGrath 2016; Ritchie 2018). My focus on the interactions between interbranch preference divergence and gridlock highlights the importance of factors internal to Congress and lawmaking for understanding the nature and shape of congressional constraint. Even when passing laws is difficult, Congress (or parts of it) possess strong nonstatutory mechanisms to direct administrative activity. These tools are used by congressional committees to sidestep the obstacles to exercising formal, statutory power over agencies. Thus, the existence and use of these nonstatutory mechanisms of control, although not as binding as a passing a law, can help committees overcome challenges in compelling agency responsiveness that arise both in Congress and in the executive branch. The Politics of Nonstatutory Control Delegation, Gridlock, and Political Control of the Bureaucracy The complexities of modern governance require delegation from the legislative to the executive branch. Legislatures consider a variety of policies, and investing substantial resources to develop expertise in all of them is impracticable. Executive branch agencies specialize, thus incentivizing legislative delegation to them to mitigate uncertain and extreme policy outcomes (e.g., Epstein and O'Halloran 1999). However, allowing other actors to make policy choices is not necessarily costless for legislators. When executive branch actors have policymaking authority, they can make policy choices that benefit them, potentially at the expense of legislative majorities. These agency losses are of particular concern to legislators when executive actors do not share their policy preferences. How Congress mitigates these agency problems has long been a subject of scholarly interest (e.g., Lowande 2018; McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast 1987; Moe 1985; Ritchie 2018; Weingast and Moran 1983). Many mechanisms of control have been studied, including limiting statutory discretion, structuring procedures, using legislation (or more specialized tools like the Congressional Review Act (CRA) or in the past, legislative vetoes) to overturn agency decisions, or anticipation wherein agencies avoid policies that will upset Congress to avoid costs. The general verdict of the literature is that Congress is able to compel responsiveness to its preferences, at least under certain conditions (e.g., Acs 2019; Ferejohn and Shipan 1990; Shipan 2004; Weingast and Moran 1983; Yackee and Yackee 2009). However, statute-based control mechanisms are less useful in times when there is substantial gridlock in Congress. Following Krehbiel (1998), I conceptualize gridlock as corresponding to conditions wherein ideological fragmentation and supermajoritarian lawmaking institutions act together to stymie the efforts of legislative majorities to change status quo policies. When policies are “gridlocked,” there is no possibility of changing them in a way that will simultaneously overcome a filibuster in the Senate and be signed by the president or command a majority that would override a presidential veto. The difficulty of passing legislation to reduce the discretion of an agency or overturn their policies is increasing in the gridlock of Congress, making control of the executive branch more difficult. This is doubly true if executive branch actors strategically exploit gridlock and choose policies they know Congress cannot muster the supermajorities to overturn. In this case, administration policies will stand protected by the presidential veto, even if legislative majorities prefer the status quo ex ante. Indeed, Howell (2003) provides evidence presidents do this with respect to executive orders. Bureaucratic actors appear similarly savvy in using their procedural advantages to stymie legislative oversight (Potter 2019). Thus, gridlock exacerbates the interbranch agency problems Congress confronts. Altogether, if these political dynamics exist, gridlock shifts power toward the executive and diminishes incentives for responsiveness to congressional preferences in public policy implementation. One may argue courts will intervene if agencies flout congressional intent. However, agencies often regulate based on vague statutes, and since Chevron, the purported posture of the federal courts is to defer to agency interpretations of their statutes. Others have pointed to appropriations statutes as a venue in which Congress can work its will legislatively by using limitation riders (e.g., MacDonald 2010). However, these are frequent subjects of presidential veto threats, and congressional actors often yield to avoid a government shutdown (Hassell and Kernell 2016). Thus, limitation riders can be effective, but they are not a panacea for congressional control. Nonstatutory Tools of Control The foregoing discussion suggests the combination of delegation to the executive branch, strategic executive actors, and gridlock serves to facilitate the aggrandizement of executive power. However, this account does not consider nonstatutory tools available to Congress to advance its interests. I argue the political and institutional constraints on congressional lawmaking power impel it to use nonstatutory mechanisms of executive control. Although I review the details of the specific nonstatutory tools I focus on in more detail later (i.e., appropriations committee reports) and other nonstatutory tools for influencing the executive, in general, this argument applies to any policy tool by which Congress can communicate its preferences to the bureaucracy that agencies view as credible statements of congressional preferences they should heed. These nonstatutory tools are not necessarily substitutes for legislation, but they may nonetheless advance congressional interests.1 Because nonstatutory control tools are not legally enforceable, their efficacy in bringing about responsiveness to Congress relies on exploiting other incentives that drive bureaucratic behavior. Two primary factors stand out and likely work together to produce agency compliance. First, compliance may be borne of repeated interactions between the agency and principals in Congress. Agencies are “repeat players” with their principals in Congress and may believe they stand to lose if relationships with long-lived principals become frayed. To maintain cooperation, however, agencies must believe there is a credible threat they will incur costs if they do not comply with nonstatutory mandates. Thus, the second factor necessary to produce compliance is that Congress has tools in its arsenal to unilaterally impose costs on recalcitrant agencies. These might take the form of contentious oversight hearings, document requests that burden agency staff, public denunciations of the agency that could harm its reputation, using its agenda control to ignore agency priorities that are less salient to Congress, and so on. In this way, the nonstatutory powers of Congress can work in tandem to ensure agency responsiveness. If a nonstatutory mechanism of bureaucratic control indeed induces compliance, it offers substantial political and policy benefits for Congress. First, it does not require presidential or often even majority assent in Congress to be effected. In that way, it overcomes gridlock concerns in Congress. Second, these types of tools can also overcome the interbranch agency problems that arise in delegating authority to the executive branch if they effectively play on agency incentives. In this article, I am interested in exploring when Congress turns to these types of nonstatutory tools to direct and oversee bureaucratic policymaking. As noted earlier, the key drawback to nonstatutory means of control is they cannot be legally enforced. Although agencies may nearly always choose to comply with statutory mandates, nonstatutory ones may not always bring about responsiveness to congressional preferences if agencies choose to disregard them because the political benefits outweigh expected future costs. My argument does not presume agencies will always comply with nonstatutory mandates to the letter (though, much of the literature reviewed below suggests they make substantial efforts to do so). However, on the margins, they may increase the probability of responsiveness and for this reason are worth investing in. For instance, if Congress could reasonably choose between nullifying a regulation it dislikes through a joint resolution pursuant to the CRA instead of using some other less binding means to urge an agency to withdraw a rule it has promulgated, then it would likely prefer the former option given that it has the force of law behind it. However, as the history of the CRA demonstrates, Congress can rarely mobilize the necessary majorities and/or presidential support for exercising options like the CRA, and instead may turn to other means of directing executive branch activity that are less susceptible to gridlock and may improve responsiveness at the margins. The sum of this discussion suggests congressional majorities increasingly use these tools when two conditions obtain: interbranch preference divergence and gridlock. First, as interbranch conflict increases, there is a greater need for Congress to assert control over executive branch actors to compel agency responsiveness. This is because when Congress and the executive branch have divergent policy and political goals, the potential for agency losses is at its highest. Second, when gridlock is higher, directing bureaucratic policymaking through legislation is more difficult due to the supermajoritarian lawmaking requirements in the U.S. political system. However, there are important interactions between these two key variables that shape congressional incentives. I argue that when both conditions are present, committees have the greatest incentive to employ nonstatutory mechanisms of control. When agency problems are minimal (i.e., when the preferences of Congress and the executive branch are relatively aligned), there is less incentive to expend time and resources on nonstatutory (or statutory) control. Under these conditions, agencies are less likely to be engaging in behavior that leads to outcomes that make congressional majorities worse off.2 Given this, the policy returns to exerting greater control are smaller. When agency problems are diminished, the effect of gridlock will be dampened because there is less desire to constrain the executive in the first place. Similarly, Congress has relatively less incentive to increase its use of nonstatutory mechanisms in situations where agency problems are present but gridlock is low (conditions that obtained, for instance, during the Ford presidency). Here, Congress is better positioned to respond legislatively to adverse agency actions. Knowing this, agencies are more likely to be responsive to the preferences of Congress when making policy because they view statutory rebukes as more credible if they step out of line. In addition, if they indeed are unresponsive to congressional preferences in their policy choices, then Congress would likely prefer a statutory to a nonstatutory response, which is more binding and is also more manageable under conditions of low gridlock, all else equal. To summarize, my argument suggests nonstatutory tools for policy direction become most attractive from the perspective of Congress when both interbranch agency and intrabranch collective action problems are present. The absence of either should lessen the reliance of congressional actors on these tools to shape the choices of executive branch actors. This suggests there is a strong and positive interactive effect of these two conditions—gridlock and interbranch division—for the production of nonstatutory policy direction by Congress. Nonstatutory Control in Previous Work Previous work on nonstatutory control of the bureaucracy has primarily focused on the role of oversight, such as through hearings, investigations, and back-channel communications with agencies. In seminal research, Fiorina (1977) and McCubbins and Schwartz (1984) argue members of Congress wait for interest groups to raise their hackles about agency decisions and then step in to claim credit for criticizing the agency's decision in an oversight venue. Subsequent work demonstrates how Congress uses these hearings to both manage agency problems and diminish an administration's public prestige (e.g., Kriner and Schwartz 2008; Kriner and Schickler 2014, 2016; MacDonald and McGrath 2016). Other research examines the influence of Congress's legislative vetoes to nullify executive branch actions (e.g., Fisher 2005; Korn 1996). Recent studies investigate the use of back-channel communications by members of Congress to influence bureaucratic decision making. For instance, Ritchie (2018) demonstrates that senators frequently communicate preferences privately to agencies, particularly when facing constituency cross-pressures. Lowande (2018) finds that there are no apparent ideological patterns to the use of back-channel oversight, instead arguing it is motivated by legislators' valence concerns. Although certainly impactful, these nonstatutory tools also have features that may limit their use and efficacy, at least from the perspective of directing and constraining agencies on a continuous basis. Oversight hearings are costly for committees to undertake and are thus often ad hoc, which may diminish their utility to provide ongoing control over bureaucratic policymaking. Informal communications may serve as a weaker signal to the bureaucracy than hearings or other communications because they do not necessarily come from privileged institutional actors or represent the collective will of Congress or a politically relevant subcomponent of it (such as an oversight committee). There are conflicting results in existing work, with agency responsiveness to back-channel communications found in some contexts but not others (e.g., Mills, Kalaf-Hughes, and MacDonald 2016; Ritchie and You 2019). Legislative vetoes, which occur after agencies' decisions may be politically costly for majorities if the policies create new constituencies that support their entrenchment and may also be subject to gridlock dynamics depending on their form. Nonstatutory Control and the Appropriations Process I focus on an institution that allows the congressional appropriations committees to exercise constraint and overcomes some of the challenges Congress faces when using other nonstatutory tools to direct and constrain agencies on a continuing basis: the issuance of reports accompanying their legislation. Each year, the subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees work on funding legislation in their jurisdictions to report to the broader committee and chamber. Committees simultaneously produce reports complementing the recommended statutory language. Traditionally, the texts of appropriations laws are spare. Instead, appropriators include specific policy instructions for agencies in these accompanying reports. The reports include a variety of directives to agencies, ranging from technical issues about how funding can be allocated to substantive commentary on agency policymaking decisions that extend outside of the appropriations process per se. Common provisions include instructions for agencies to make particular policy decisions, setting priorities for the agency, reporting requirements, prior notification requirements, deadlines, earmarks, requirements to conduct studies and investigate particular policies, staffing instructions (levels for the agency, particular offices, etc.), consultation requirements, planning requirements, requirements to continue or adjust levels of certain activities, and more (Bolton and Thrower 2019; Fenno 1966; Kiewiet and McCubbins 1991; Kirst 1969; Schick 2008). The reports have also been seen as a safe haven for legislative vetoes in the wake of the INS v. Chadha decision, which declared these provisions in laws unconstitutional (Fisher 2005). The existing literature has long noted that agencies take care to comply with committee directives for the reasons discussed above—repeated interactions between agencies and committees and the credible threat of costs for noncompliance (Bolton and Thrower 2019; Fenno 1966; Fisher 2005; Kirst 1969; Schick 2008; Tollestrup 2015). With respect to repeated interactions, agencies are required to come to Congress annually in the appropriations process. Members of the appropriations committees tend to be long-serving, and subcommittee chairs often return to the helm even after their party has been out of power. Although the appointed leadership of agencies tends to be shorter lived, other work notes the importance of longer lived staff-level relationships between the appropriations committees and mezzo-level agency leadership that may also help to induce cooperation (e.g., Aberbach 1990; Ginieczki 2010; Schick 2008). Even exiting appointees may comply with congressional mandates if they value how the agency fares going forward or relationships with Congress in their postgovernment careers.3 The appropriations committees also have all of the tools discussed above (e.g., costly oversight, onerous document requests, agenda control, ability to limit discretion) at their disposal to impose costs on noncompliant agencies as needed, which helps to sustain cooperation. Indeed, the committees remind agencies of this fact. In its FY 2015 report (H. Rpt. 113-468), the House Agriculture appropriations subcommittee admonished the Food and Nutrition Service about the importance of complying with deadlines imposed by the committee: “The directives and issues that are specified in the House, Senate, or conference report are very important to the Committee and the dates specified are mandatory …FNS is reminded that the Committee reserves the right to call before it any agency that does not submit reports on time.” Thus, employing (or threatening to employ) other nonstatutory tools, like oversight hearings, that impose costs on agencies increases the likelihood of agency compliance. Although systematic evidence of report influence on policy outcomes is difficult to gather given the diversity of topics and organizations covered in the reports, in-depth qualitative case studies of committee–agency interactions provide strong evidence that they are influential on agency behavior (Ginieczki 2010; Kirst 1969). Indeed, Schick (2008) describes agencies' conscientious efforts to please appropriators even when their directives seem to conflict: “Agencies are expected to follow the guidance of all reports …For example, if the House report earmarks a portion of the funds in an account to project A, the Senate report earmarks to project B, and the conference report to project C, the agency is expected to allocate the specified funds to each of the projects. The same rule applies to other types of guidance in appropriations reports.”4 Furthermore, organizations that lobby in the appropriations process often see influencing report language as an important goal, which is suggestive of the power of reports to affect outcomes. For example, in one organization's appropriations lobbying strategy for FY 2020, 21 of the 24 objectives were focused on influencing report language.5 Though reports are approved by the full appropriations committee, they are primarily written by the staffs of the relevant subcommittees under the direction of their chairs, who are often referred to as “cardinals” because of the authority they wield (Berry and Fowler 2016; Fenno 1966). To understand the types of policy content included in the reports, consider this example from the FY 2017 Senate Interior and Environment report commenting on a Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rulemaking:6 No provision in the statutory text this report accompanied mentioned the EPA's rulemaking. Further, the directive was not sanctioned by the Senate as a whole. Rather, the committee acted unilaterally to instruct the EPA. Ultimately, a new rule was proposed at the end of the Obama administration, though it was never finalized, and the Part 192 rulemaking remains as yet unresolved. This example demonstrates how these nonstatutory tools are used to communicate with agencies about their current and future policymaking activities. The committee had other options. First, it might have included a rider in legislation prohibiting the agency from using funds to finalize the rulemaking. However, this approach could fail if the president or other legislators supported the rule. Second, the committee might have held hearings to indicate displeasure. However, relative to a few sentences in a report, the costs Congress imposes on itself (in terms of both committee and member resources and the opportunity costs associated with the hearing) make this option relatively unattractive as an initial attempt to influence policy. Finally, Congress could have waited until the regulation was finalized to overturn it using the CRA. However, this approach would necessitate presidential approval, and no president has signed a CRA resolution targeting a regulation from their own administration. Furthermore, once the regulation is promulgated, new constituencies benefiting from it may work against nullification efforts, raising the political costs of action. As this discussion illustrates, the use of appropriations reports to instruct agencies can help Congress overcome both collective action problems and interbranch agency problems. Because they do not require a full chamber vote or presidential signature, they can bypass the gridlock dynamics endemic in the legislative process. Further, because agencies have strong incentives to comply, reports can mitigate interbranch agency problems. Thus, I would predict as both gridlock and interbranch agency problems increase, committees resort more often to incorporating instructions to agencies in these nonstatutory control mechanisms. Data and Research Design To evaluate my argument, I collected a new data set of appropriations committee reports that accompanied legislation from the House and Senate appropriations committees for FY 1923 through FY 2019. This encompasses observations from 49 congresses and 98 congress–chamber pairs. The unit of analysis is the report-chamber-year. Thus, for instance, the subcommittee report accompanying the House Agriculture bill for a particular FY constitutes a single observation and the report from the analogous Senate committee from that year constitutes a separate observation.8 I begin with FY 1923 (reports issued in calendar year 1922) because this is the first FY under the process of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 (BAA), which sets out general procedures for executive budgeting and congressional appropriations still in place today. The reports were obtained as PDFs from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and Congressional Proquest. CRS catalogs appropriations reports from FY 1999 through the present.9 To identify earlier reports, I compiled a list of appropriations legislation from the Statutes at Large and collected the House and Senate committee reports associated with those public law numbers through Congressional Proquest.10 From the reports, I construct two dependent variables to measure the extent of nonstatutory policymaking they contain. The first is the report length in words (Report Length). This measure assumes length corresponds to a greater degree of policy direction and agency constraint. When constructing this variable, I omitted end matter that does not contain policy information (e.g., chamber-specific reporting requirements, minority views, alternative views, separate views, voting records when present, budget authority comparison tables).11 To obtain word counts from the PDF documents, I used Thomas Leeper's pdfcount software.12 The number of words per report is highly variable, with a mean of 29,484, a median of 20,312, and a standard deviation of 28,265. The distribution of word counts is right-skewed and the residuals are skewed when modeling raw word counts, so in the analyses, I model the natural logarithm of the word count. This length-based measure has advantages and disadvantages. It captures the variety of policy directives and constraints the reports can include; however, it is also overinclusive and counts language that is boilerplate or unrelated to the core conceptual ideas of interest. A second concern is the conditions I expect to produce greater policy direction and constraint (i.e., gridlock and interbranch division) also make legislation more difficult to pass, and longer reports may reflect log-rolling and universalism rather than conflict-based attempts to constrain executive policymaking. I address these concerns in three ways. First, to examine the possibility of universalism, in Table A10 (SI p. 16), I examine whether the conditions I expect to produce constraint also produce more consensus in committee votes in the limited set of reports containing vote breakdowns. I do not find evidence of this. Second, I conducted content analysis to determine whether length is significantly associated with the volume of specific constraints on bureaucratic policymaking to buttress the Report Length variable's content validity. Third, I use this content analysis to construct an alternative dependent variable that is more directly linked to specific bureaucratic constraints than the length-based measure. In particular, I coded three commonly recognized policymaking directives and constraints in the bureaucratic politics literature.13 First, I identified reporting requirements, where the committee mandated agencies investigate and report on specific information, policy alternatives or actions. Second, I coded for deadlines imposed by the committee for specific actions. Finally, I coded provisions mandating the agency provide prior notification to the committee before taking a particular action (which are typically associated with legislative vetoes). The average report in my data set contained 15.4 reporting requirements (maximum = 129), 13.6 deadlines (maximum = 173), and 2.8 prior notification requirements (maximum = 35). The three leftmost panels of Figure 1 display the relationships between the volume of each constraint and report length. All three have fairly high correlations with report length (reported on plots). The three constraint types are also highly interrelated (Cronbach's α = 0.94). As such, I created a separate variable, Constraint Index, which is an estimated factor score resulting from a factor analysis of the incidence of the three constraints. This variable is also highly correlated with overall report length, as can be seen in the final panel of Figure 1. I use this scale as an alternative dependent variable in my analyses.14 The advantages and disadvantages of this variable are the reverse of Report Length: It has specific substantive referents rooted in concepts I am interested in, however, it is underinclusive and neglects other kinds of policy constraint and directives included in report language. To the extent both the Report Length and Constraint Index measures produce consistent results, it alleviates concerns measurement error in either is unduly driving conclusions. Empirically evaluating the theoretical argument requires two key independent variables: interbranch agency problems and gridlock. Their interaction is the central test of the argument. I characterize interbranch agency problems resulting from policy and political disagreements between Congress and the executive branch in three ways. First, I rely primarily on a partisan-based measure, Interbranch Division, which takes the value “0” when the presidency and chamber majority are controlled by the same party and “1” otherwise. This variable can take different values for the House and Senate in the same year if they are controlled by different parties. I alternatively use the absolute distance between the DW-NOMINATE Common Space scores of the subcommittee chair producing the report and the president (Chair-President Distance). Finally, I also use the distance between the president and the full appropriations committee median, because the full committee ultimately approves the report and bill (Comm.-Pres. Dist.). I do not use the two distance measures as the primary measure because presidential DW-NOMINATE scores (especially prior to World War II) are often based on very little data, and in some cases (such as for President Hoover) are not even estimated. To measure gridlock (denoted Gridlock, below), I rely on DW-NOMINATE scores to calculate equilibrium gridlock intervals for each Congress based on Krehbiel (1998). These correspond to the absolute distance between the ideal points of the filibuster pivot in the Senate (i.e., the 40th percentile senator [or 33rd, depending on the year] ideologically from the opposite end of the ideological spectrum as the president) and either the most extreme veto pivot in the House or the Senate (i.e., the 33rd percentile senator or representative from the president's end of the ideological spectrum) or the president's ideal point if it is more moderate than either of the veto override pivots.15 This variable captures the difficulty Congress faces in passing legislation to address interbranch agency problems. In some models, I also include controls that may confound the relationships between my key independent variables and their interaction and the length of reports. First, I include fixed effects for subcommittee–chair pairs. These control for time-invariant features of subcommittees and the individuals with the most power over report contents. The subcommittee portion controls, for instance, for the subcommittee's policy jurisdiction or norms within the subcommittee about report structures and features. The chair portion controls for individual characteristics that might dispose them toward writing shorter or longer reports.16 I also account for time trends in two ways, including a global time trend or committee-chair–specific time trends depending on the specification. This accounts for secular changes over time in the length of reports and the independent variables (particularly gridlock) that might confound the results. The committee-chair–specific trends offer a more flexible way of accounting for these same time trends if they vary within units.17 Some models include other controls. First, I account for the logged millions of dollars of budget authority contained in the bill (Bill Amount). All dollar amounts are inflation-adjusted to 2012 dollars.18 I also control for situations when a committee is evenly divided between the Republicans and Democrats (Even Partisanship). This happens in few instances (primarily in the pre–World War II era), however, it has implications for understanding whether an interbranch agency problem exists between the committee and executive branch.19 I also control for years in which the House and Senate are controlled by different parties because this might be related to gridlock and report length if committees try to counteract the instructions of one another (Divided Chambers). Next, I control for two time-related factors. First, I include an indicator for FYs in which the earmark ban is in place, because those provisions typically appeared in the text of reports (Earmark Ban).20 Second, I include an indicator for the final Congress that a subcommittee chair is in office because this is correlated with time and may impact policymaking effort (Last Congress). Finally, the full models also include variables capturing the resources available to the subcommittees. Writing reports takes substantial staff effort, and these variables are meant to control for the general levels of resources available to committees given there is little detailed resource information for the appropriations committees over this whole time period. The first is an indicator for years in which the reports are written after the passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (Post-LRA), which endowed the appropriations committee with substantially greater staff resources than it had before.21 Second, I include an indicator variable for reports written after Republicans took control of the House and Senate in the 1994 midterm elections (Post-Gingrich). A key component of the Contract With America was to cut committee staff by one-third, which significantly affected resources (Bolton and Thrower 2016). All the models reported in this article are ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. In the main text, I report robust standard errors clustered at the level of Congress-chamber pair. This is the level at which Interbranch Division varies. The Gridlock variable varies by 2-year Congress, however, so in Tables A1 and A2 (SI pp. 7–8), I pursue additional clustering options including at this and other plausible levels. The statistical significance of the results is not materially affected by clustering at different levels. Results I now turn to the results of these analyses, displayed in Table 1. Across different specifications, I find support for the hypothesized interactive effects. Models 1–4 examine the Report Length variable, whereas Model 5 examines the alternative Constraint Index variable. Model 1 is the simplest, including only Ideological Division, Gridlock, and the fixed effects. I do not find any consistent, significant effects; however, this is not unexpected—my theoretical framework predicts a strong interactive effect between the two variables. Indeed, turning to Model 2, I find some evidence for the expected interaction without controls.22 In Model 3, I add the previously discussed control variables, including a global time trend, and the results are maintained. Models 4 and 5 present the full specifications for both dependent variables, accounting for time even more flexibly by including chair and committee-specific time trends. In both cases, the estimated coefficients line up with theoretical expectations, with little difference across the dependent variables. The substantive effects of interactions and their constituent terms are difficult to interpret on their own, particularly when one variable is continuous over a limited range. Therefore, I plot the estimated marginal effects of Interbranch Division and Gridlock on the Constraint Index at different levels of the other in Figure 2 based on the estimates from Model 5. The left panel displays the estimated marginal effect of Interbranch Division as gridlock varies. Here, we see the predicted positive relationship. When gridlock is low, I estimate an insignificant relationship between Interbranch Division and the Constraint Index. However, at higher levels of gridlock, the estimated marginal effect of Interbranch Division is positive and statistically significant. To make the effect sizes more concrete, consider the conditions of the 112th Congress (2011–12), one in which gridlock was high but the House and the Senate were controlled by different parties. The results of the model suggest reports from the chamber opposed to the president (in that case, the House) would score 0.37 standard deviations higher on the Constraint Index than the Senate's reports. In Table A13 (SI p. 23), I estimate the same models using each component of the Constraint Index separately and find the estimated impact of Interbranch Division at this level of gridlock is a 124% increase in reporting requirements, a 60% increase in deadlines, and a 14% increase in notification requirements. Finally, the results from Model 4 indicate a predicted 23% increase in total report length under the same conditions. In the right panel of Figure 2, I plot the estimated marginal effect of a one-unit change in Gridlock under conditions when partisan division is absent and present. When chamber majorities and presidents are copartisans, the estimated effect of gridlock is not statistically distinguishable from zero. However, as agency problems increase (i.e., when the chamber majority and president are not copartisans), the effect of Gridlock is positive and statistically significant. For concreteness, consider an increase in gridlock of 0.094, which represents the difference between the DW-NOMINATE scores of Senators Ben Nelson (D-NE) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME), who were the filibuster pivots in the 111th Congress before and after, respectively, Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA) was elected to fill the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's (D-MA) seat. Such an increase in Gridlock would be associated with an approximately 0.10 standard deviation increase in Constraint Index, or (based on the estimates in SI Table A13, p. 23) an increase of 23% for reporting requirements, 16% for deadlines, and 4% for notification requirements under conditions of partisan division. Inter-Congress swings can have even larger effects. For example, shifting from the gridlock levels of the 111th to the 112th Congress is associated with a 0.38 standard deviation increase in the Constraint Index, or increases of 111%, 73%, and 17% in reporting requirements, deadlines, and notifications, respectively when agency problems are relatively high. In Models 1 and 2 of Table 2, I use DW-NOMINATE Common Space scores to calculate the absolute ideological distance between the subcommittee chair and the president as an alternative to the party-based Interbranch Division measure. I find the results are little changed using this alternative measure. Similarly, in Models 3 and 4, I model the distance between the overall appropriations committee median and the president as a measure of interbranch conflict. The results are substantively identical to those in Models 1 and 2, which is unsurprising given the chair and committee median are always copartisans (and thus have relatively similar ideal points). Robustness: Nonstatutory Policymaking and Intraparty Conflict The preceding results suggest the political dynamics of gridlock and lawmaking play an important role in structuring the use of nonstatutory tools in the appropriations process. However, it is possible the results may be driven by ideological fragmentation within the majority party rather than gridlock (especially if they are correlated). Prior research on the appropriations process has often focused on how intraparty political dynamics within a chamber structure outcomes. If this is a primary locus of political conflict for appropriators, then system-level gridlock may be only a small part of the politics of nonstatutory policy direction in the appropriations process. I focus on this possibility here. Previous work on the appropriations process examines whether appropriators use their influence to subvert the political and policy goals of the broader chamber majority. The existing literature provides conflicting accounts. Kiewiet and McCubbins (1991) present results suggesting parties can successfully manage principal–agent problems that arise between the appropriations committees and the broader majority caucus. Other studies (e.g., Hanson 2014) suggest the weakness of parties over time has led to a shift from the autonomy of the appropriations committees toward more concentrated power within party leadership. However, both classic research (e.g., Fenno 1966) and recent work by Woon and Anderson (2012) emphasize the autonomy of the appropriations committees and their ability to gain favorable outcomes due to the chamber's deference to their expertise or agenda-setting power. Indeed, appropriations reports have been cited as a way appropriators can undermine the will of other committees and the broader chamber going back to Kirst (1969). Reports do not have to be voted on by the full chamber, yet they nonetheless have apparent influence over agency behavior. If appropriators disagree substantively with the broader majority in the chamber, they may opt to include policy instructions in reports rather than in legislation given the former are not subject to review by the broader chamber. Indeed, work on the appropriations process often stresses conflicts between the committee and other powerful actors, such as the authorizing committees overseeing the same programs (Hall 2004). Facing these types of conflicts, appropriators may be tempted to exercise their nonstatutory tools to gain an advantage over other institutional actors in directing the executive branch. To assess the degree of committee autonomy detectable in the use of appropriations reports, Table 3 replicates the analysis in Table 1. However, instead of Gridlock, I construct a measure of ideological divergence between the subcommittee chair responsible for the report and the broader majority party caucus, Chair-Party Dist. This measure is simply the absolute distance between the DW-NOMINATE Common Space scores of the subcommittee chair and the majority party median.23 If appropriators use reports to subvert the goals of the chamber majority, the interaction coefficient for Interbranch Division and Chair-Party Dist. will be positive and significant, suggesting committees turn to them more when their preferences diverge from the broader majority party and the executive branch. If the interaction coefficient is null, however, this would be more consistent with a lack of autonomy. The results in Table 3 provide no clear support for the appropriations committee autonomy theory. Across the five specifications nearly all the estimated coefficients for both interacted and uninteracted effects of Chair-Party Dist. are statistically insignificant. The appropriations committees do not appear to use nonstatutory tools to overcome political and ideological disagreements within their own parties.24 Such seeming restraint may stem from the desire of the committee to avoid sanction from the party caucus for using its power to make the majority of the majority party worse off (e.g., Cox and McCubbins 2005). Whatever the mechanism, it appears parties effectively manage agency problems that may arise between them and the committee. These results combined with those presented earlier, suggest the use of reports in the appropriations process is a function of broader ideological fragmentation within Congress and its relationship to lawmaking. When passing statutes is difficult, Congress turns instead to its nonstatutory control mechanisms to minimize the effects of interbranch agency problems and impel agency responsiveness to congressional preferences. Discussion and Conclusion Whether the preferences of legislatures and other political actors are represented in the policy decisions made by bureaucracies is a central question for the accountability of the administrative state. The balance of the literature rejects the idea that Congress abdicates when delegating, and a large literature delineates the mechanisms Congress and its committees use to engage in continuing control over the executive branch. However, policy gridlock can undermine congressional control. As the goals of legislative actors diverge, mustering the support and votes to constrain executive branch actors becomes more challenging. Under these circumstances, agencies can seemingly pursue policies that benefit them (and potentially not legislative majorities) that cannot be overturned legislatively due to gridlock. As Barber and McCarty (2015, p. 44) write, “Perhaps one of the most important long-term consequences of the decline in legislative capacity caused by polarization is that Congress's power is declining relative to the other branches of government.” I argue Congress is not altogether helpless in the face of increasing gridlock and can cope (at least in part) by using nonstatutory means to direct agencies. Although most previous work in this area focuses on how oversight hearings can be used to impose costs on agencies and communicate congressional displeasure, I explore a less visible, yet regularly used, means of congressional direction—reports issued by the appropriations committees that provide instructions to agencies about issues related to spending and other policy decisions the agency has made or is in the process of making. These reports help committees overcome the issues associated with gridlock in the face of agency losses from bureaucratic implementation of policies. Because they do not need to be ratified by any of the agency's other principals, committees can more easily overcome the collective action problems that would otherwise be attendant if they sought to control agencies through legislation. In this way, the reports help committees to solve both their interbranch principal–agent and intrabranch gridlock problems. This argument yields predictions about when specifically committees will use nonstatutory mechanisms of control to constrain and direct executive policymaking. When both interbranch conflict and gridlock obtain, committees will find these tools to be an effective way to overcome both interbranch and intrabranch obstacles to directing agencies through legislation. However, when either condition is absent, committees turn less often to nonstatutory means of control. Using a new data set of appropriations committee reports issued since 1922, I find strong support for these hypotheses. One may question whether the unique features of appropriations committee reports limit the generalizability of the conclusions reached here. However, this shift in focus from statutory to nonstatutory forms of policy direction and oversight is consonant with other recent developments in the separation of powers literature. Both Acs (2019) and Chiou and Rothenberg (2017) conjecture nonstatutory tools are central to congressional constraint of executive power they observe in the contexts of regulation and unilateral action. Barber, Bolton, and Thrower (2019) provide evidence of the role legislative vetoes play in constraining gubernatorial unilateralism. There is also suggestive evidence from other studies that patterns in the use of other nonstatutory tools may reflect similar political dynamics to those I highlight here. For example, Kriner and Schickler (2016) find the effect of divided government on the production of executive branch investigations in Congress is increasing in partisan polarization. Though they undertake this analysis to test their argument that the effect of divided government depends on the partisan stakes (which they proxy for with polarization), the result is also clearly consistent with my broader argument about the roles that legislative dysfunction and interbranch conflict play in producing nonstatutory policymaking. More generally, this work complements conceptual and theoretical developments that place renewed emphasis on informal policymaking institutions in advanced democracies (e.g., Azari and Smith 2012). Overall, this article provides new insights into how Congress overcomes often-debilitating gridlock to still maintain some control over the activities of the executive branch. Although nonstatutory forms of political control lack the binding force of law, they may nonetheless serve to communicate the preferences of relevant congressional overseers when passing laws is impracticable. In this way, Congress may still continue to govern in an age when governance is seemingly more complex and difficult than ever."
15,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA02-2022-AJPS.txt," Polities shape power structures and interaction patterns between actors in policymaking processes. Although the social fabric of interactions is key to successful policymaking, it remains unclear which relational structures are typically found across political systems. By adopting a network approach, we analyse differences in power structures and interaction patterns across four policy networks in German and Swiss consensual–federal, French majoritarian–unitary, and hybrid Dutch consensual–unitary democracies. Using survey data from 149 state and non-state actors, we fit exponential random graph models and calculate predicted probabilities to compare the four networks. Results show that the consensus democracies institutionalize neighbourhoods of networks where actors share power and collaborate with opponents. Our case of a majoritarian democracy illustrates power concentration with restricted access to competitors, limiting the need to interact and search for compromises with opponents. Findings allow future work to differentiate typical from atypical network structures, given the embeddedness into a political system. Policy networks can be understood as social maps of policymaking processes, which provide a synthetic overview of the actors involved in policymaking, their interactions or power dependencies (Börzel 1998; Dowding 1995, p. 157). Although policymaking has long been described as a black box where a societal problem ‘goes in’ and a policy solution ‘comes out’, the policy network approach offers an analytical tool to uncover the social processes in the ‘black box’ (Easton 1965; Immergut 1992; Metz 2017). The question of how policy networks operate has generated an important amount of scholarly work. Scholars have analysed patterns of collaboration (Desmarais et al. 2015; Gerber, Henry, and Lubell 2013; Metz, Leifeld, and Ingold 2019), coordination (Matti and Sandström 2011) or information exchange (Angst and Brandenberger Forthcoming; Leifeld and Schneider 2012) in policy networks in order to understand the reasons for why policy actors establish contacts, or fail to do so. Drivers of network structure that scholars have investigated include perceived influence (e.g. Ingold and Leifeld 2016), similarity of ideology and preferences (e.g. Henry, Lubell, and McCoy 2011) or social trust (e.g. Di Cagno and Sciubba 2010). Scant attention has been paid to the institutional opportunity structures that political systems create for policy networks (exceptions include Gronow, Wagner, and Ylä-Anttila 2019; Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006, whose studies fail to address methodological aspects in comparing networks). To date, we know relatively little about the structural aspects that policy networks exhibit given their embeddedness into a political system. In order to address this gap, we explore whether political systems provide opportunity structures for the emergence of certain network structures over others. We employ the term political system to refer to a country's macro-political architecture, which, in democracies, is typically defined by horizontal and vertical distribution of power and electoral rules. Political systems institutionalize a modus operandi which is reflected in the way policy processes operate, that is, in the actors participating in policymaking, and in actors' decision-making power and interactions. Given this stable institutional arrangement, it is unlikely that every type of network can form, but networks are likely to belong to a neighbourhood of networks with similar structural aspects (Lubell et al. 2012). We ask: Does the institutional context across political systems systematically shape the structure of policy networks? It is well-established that institutions matter in shaping policy content (North 1990). Despite uncontested institutionalism, the literature has difficulties linking a country's political system and its policies across time and policy fields (Lijphart 1999). Rather than creating a direct link, some authors suggest instead an indirect impact, mediated via policy networks (Bressers and O'Toole 1998; Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006). As such, the network approach can provide a powerful tool for uncovering the ways in which political systems (i.e. polity) shape policy processes (i.e. politics), thereby constraining possible policy outputs (i.e. policy). To illustrate our argument, we compare policy networks in four countries, which vary with regard to their political systems. Whereas Switzerland and Germany both exemplify consensual–federal democracies, France is a classic majoritarian–unitary system, and the Netherlands a hybrid form of federal–unitary democracy. In these countries, we analyse existing network properties given the institutional frame. We focus on two network properties: interaction and power patterns in policymaking. Thereby, we explore structural aspects characterizing the neighbourhoods of networks across political systems and shed light on the social environments that produce (or fail to produce) policy outputs across political systems. For this cross-national comparison, we limit cases to one policy domain, that is, water protection. Our goal is to conceive of a model that captures the structural aspects of policy networks across political systems. Comparisons between networks of varying size represent an inherent challenge for network research (see, e.g. Friedkin 1981). Our approach distinguishes itself from previous comparative studies on policy networks (e.g. Brockhaus and Di Gregorio 2014; Wagner et al. 2021) by making use of advanced network inference tools. To capture the link between network structures and political systems across countries, we rely on the use of micro-level interpretations of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) (Desmarais and Cranmer 2012) and comparing predicted probabilities based on ERGMs (Faust and Skvoretz 2002). This allows us to take a global view on the networks and compare individual structural aspects between the networks, while holding other aspects of the network constant (as compared to Brockhaus and Di Gregorio 2014 or Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006). As a result, we can compare structural aspects of policy networks across countries and link them to the political system in a comparative manner. Policy Networks and Patterns of Democracy The network approach to policymaking begins with the assumption that the most important elements that shape policymaking are the relationships of influence among policy actors (Knoke 1994). Actors exert influence through various relations, including gathering and disseminating information (Leifeld and Schneider 2012), discussing policy options, exchanging positions or collaborating with allies (Weible and Sabatier 2007). Yet, actors' opportunities to exert influence vary by political systems. Consensus-oriented political systems, more so than their majoritarian counterparts, incentivize actors to coordinate and bargain with opponents in order to reach a compromise (Fischer 2014). Political systems mediate actors' opportunities to exert influence and thereby shape politics, which should be reflected in the structure of policy networks. Policy networks represent a structural depiction of the policymaking process (Knoke 1994). Building on the structural perspective of politics, we define policy networks as aggregated snapshots of multi-actor interactions in the policymaking processes over time. Most studies that analyse the structure of policy networks focus on power dependencies and interaction patterns, which cannot be understood independently from political systems. Formal and informal institutions shape power dependencies and interactions between policy actors in the policymaking process, thereby also shaping networks. Lijphart (1999) establishes a typology of modern democracies, which proves relevant to the study of policy networks, that is, actors' power dependencies and interactions. He differentiates the extent to which states formally and informally concentrate or diffuse political responsibility, based on two dimensions: vertical division of power termed the federal–unitary dimension, and horizontal division of power, the executive–party dimension (see also Vatter and Stadelmann-Steffen 2013). Ideal–typical majoritarian democracies are characterized by unitary and centralized governments (on the federal–unitary dimension), a competitive two-party system out of which one majority party controls the entire government and dominates the parliament, a first-past-the-post electoral system and a competitive interest group pluralism (on the executive–party dimension). Distinctive is the concentration of power in the hands of the majority, typically in the form of one-party cabinets (Lijphart 1999, p. 91). While competition and majority rule guide policymaking processes in majoritarian democracies, compromise-seeking and consensual negotiations are emphasized in consensus democracies (Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006; Lijphart 1999; Vatter 2014, p. 56). Consensus democracies are defined by federal and decentralized governments (on the federal–unitary dimension); multi-party systems, executive power sharing, balance of power between the executive and the legislative, proportional representation, and interest group corporatism (on the executive–party dimension). According to those characteristics, ideal–typical consensual democracies restrain power from governmental and parliamentary majorities, they strengthen participatory rights of political minorities, and they emphasize the diffusion of power (Schmidt 2010). To overcome political conflicts, political elites are incentivized to work towards amicable agreements in both parliamentary and extra-parliamentary phases of policymaking processes. In summary, Lijpharts typology distinguishes between consensual–federal and majoritarian–unitary democracies at the extremes, and consensual–unitary as well as majoritarian–federal democracies as hybrid forms of democracies. These macro-political institutions should impact the patterns of ties among policy actors. Distribution of Power Distribution of power constitutes a fundamental aspect of policy networks, as powerful actors hold greater leverage in influencing policy outputs according to their preferences. Depending on how power is distributed across the entire network, the courses of policy action can be in line with the preferences of only a few or various actors. Policy networks have been described as relationships of power dependencies (Henning 2009). Power can refer to actors' attributes or to their relational profile. The former refers to the attribution of power to specific types of actors, such as state actors, through institutionally defined formal authority to propose, adopt or implement legislation (Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006). The latter definition of power represents a network characteristic. Central actors with many ties or those with a strategic position in the network can be regarded as powerful, because their relational profiles enable them to control the flow of information, or, more generally, other network members. Several network typologies employ power as a key criterion for differentiating types of policy networks (Adam and Kriesi 2007; Van Waarden 1992). At one end of the continuum are policy networks, which distribute power across (groups of) actors; at the other end are networks, which concentrate power among a few actors (or one dominant group of actors) (Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006). Whether power is concentrated or diffused in the network depends on the type of political system (Adam and Kriesi 2007; Ingold and Leifeld 2016; Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006). In consensus democracies, several organizations typically share power, and within those organizations, different political forces further divide the power. Several institutions contribute to the diffusion of power. Proportional representation and interest group corporatism, for example, restrict power from parliamentary or governmental majorities. Such diffusion of power should be reflected in the structure of policy networks where several central network actors share power (Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006). Although a diffusion of power is typical for consensus democracies, majoritarian democracies tend to concentrate power (Lijphart 1999). We therefore expect policy networks in majoritarian democracies to be centralized around only a few actors. Based on these theoretical foundations, we formulate the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1. (Power)The more a country's political system resembles an ideal–typical consensus democracy (or: majoritarian democracy), the more likely policy networks are to exhibit a diffusion (or: concentration) of power in the hands of several (or: few) actors. Types of Interactions Political systems do not only structure power dependencies but also interaction patterns between policy actors. The term interactions is generic and refers to various social relations that actors maintain, such as information exchange, negotiations or collaboration. Such interactions are decisive in building trust and social capital (Berardo and Scholz 2010; Coleman 1990), overcoming divergences and reaching a policy decision (Fischer 2014; Hermans et al. 2013), promoting actors organizing or problem-solving capacities, and actors' ability to find solutions for policy problems (Provan and Kenis 2007). As a result of interactions in the network, collective policy outputs are more likely to be adopted (Weible and Sabatier 2007). The basic characteristics of interactions are their quantity and quality. Quantity refers to the density of interactions, whereas quality pertains to the way in which objectives are distributed among actors (Bressers and O'Toole 1998). A high density of interactions means that many interaction points exist among actors, and, low density signifies that few opportunities for exchange are present. Actors exchange within formal and informal arenas of the policymaking process. Examples of formal arenas include parliamentary committees or cabinet meetings, where actors meet and negotiate various policies. Informal arenas can refer to, among others, ad hoc working groups or workshops. Such formal and informal arenas create opportunities for dense interaction patterns. Another central aspect of policy networks is the distribution of objectives, also termed beliefs, among network members (Weible and Sabatier 2007). Beliefs refer to actors' underlying values that guide their policy preferences and (inter)actions. Sharing beliefs often means that actors agree on the general need to take policy action and on the direction of such action. With shared beliefs, actors empathize with each other and self-identify as cohesive clusters or coalitions drawing a line between them and their opponents (Bressers and O'Toole 1998). Actors' interactions are likely to be consensual among actors with shared beliefs. By contrast, across belief-dissimilar actors, interactions are likely to be rather conflictual. Both quantity and quality of interactions can be combined into a typology of policy networks (Bressers and O'Toole 1998). One dimension captures few versus many interactions among actors (quantity), whereas the other dimension depicts conflictual versus consensual interactions (quality). A country's political system mediates whether actors exhibit only few or many opportunities to interact, as well as the extent to which policy processes are open to diverse types of actors and potential clashes of interests. Political systems diverge with regard to participation mechanisms, that is, the degree to which they give access to a large diversity of actors with diverging and potentially conflicting beliefs, or, instead restrain access to belief-similar actors. Furthermore, political systems are distinct in the degrees to which they provide for consensus-seeking mechanisms across belief-dissimilar actors or groups of actors, or whether they lack institutionalized conflict-settlement. Interactions in Consensus Democracies Consensus democracies integrate a variety of actors from the political spectrum into the policymaking process, and include conflict-settlement mechanisms through consensus-seeking mechanisms. Due to proportional electoral rules, the legislature and government tend to include a diverse set of parties across the political spectrum (e.g. multi-party governments), which must then reach a compromise. Likewise, corporatism creates participatory processes, which can provide access to policymaking to a diversity of non-state actors. For example, tripartite commissions are stable arenas between state, labour and employer organizations, which institutionalize exchange. Policy processes that welcome diverse political actors, allow space for diverging opinions. To circumvent conflicts, ideal–typical consensus democracies, according to Lijphart (1999), provide strong incentives for compromise and negotiation across belief dissimilarities. Institutionalized consultative procedures exist, which establish arenas for interactions among actors, such as legislative committees, consultation procedures, working groups or advisory bodies. These arenas promote negotiations in cases of conflict and induce cooperative styles of policymaking (Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006). As such, consultation procedures increase the level of connectedness between policy actors (Bressers and O'Toole 1998, p. 219). For consensus democracies, we expect that network structures reflect the cooperative style of policymaking by means of close-knit, interconnected patterns of ties among network members, in general, and among actors with diverging beliefs, in particular (Adam and Kriesi 2007). Whereas consensus democracies are said to provide strong incentives for cooperation, majoritarian democracies are known for their competitive style of policymaking (Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006; Lijphart 1999). Interactions in Majoritarian Democracies Interactions in majoritarian democracies follow a fundamentally different logic than in consensus democracies. Majoritarian democracies tend to exclude parts of the political spectrum to the advantage of one clear majority. Clear majorities are more likely to comprise a group of belief-similar actors (e.g. one-party governments), which are then less prone to conflictual interactions. Majoritarian democracies provide access to policymaking to a less diverse set of political parties due to first-past-the-post and two-party systems. As a result, clear majorities build, which then have leverage to act and adopt policies. Additionally, there exists transparency regarding the party responsible for adopting of a certain policy. Interest group pluralism tends to parallel a diversified, competitive landscape of non-state actors. Additionally, pluralist nations tend to lack stable arenas for exchange. Nevertheless, interest groups may participate in policymaking, but in a less institutionalized form than is the case for consensus democracies. Policy processes that are closed, that is, only include a homogeneous set of political actors, provide less room for diverging opinions. As such, building clear majorities can aid to prevent conflictual interactions. However, majoritarian democracies lack both formal and informal incentives for cooperative and consensual styles of policymaking. As a results, belief-dissimilar actors are less likely to interact with one another. Under such circumstances, if clear majorities fail to build, majoritarian democracies find themselves locked into particularly polarized conflicts that also lack conflict-settlement mechanisms. In majoritarian democracies, informal rules are thought to underline more competitive interaction patterns along with a unilateral style of policymaking (Adam and Kriesi 2007). We expect network interactions to be less close-knit and more competitive in nature compared to consensus democracies. Across coalitions, conflictive types of interactions are likely to be common as these systems typically lack consultation mechanisms and provide incentives for competition. Combining insights on consensus and majoritarian democracies, we hypothesize the following network structures: Hypothesis 2. (Interactions)The more a countries' political system resembles an ideal–typical consensus democracy (or: majoritarian democracy), the greater the likelihood that policy networks exist with close-knit cooperative (or: sparse competitive) interactions among policy actors. In summary, we propose a two-dimensional typology of network structures in Table 1, in which the distribution of power constitutes the first dimension, whereas the second is denoted by the types of interactions (Adam and Kriesi 2007; Bressers and O'Toole 1998). Together these two dimensions distinguish network structures in consensus and majoritarian democracies. Data and Methods Case We illustrate our argument by comparing cases from (a) Germany and Switzerland, which are both typical consensual–federal democracies; (b) France, a classic example of a majoritarian–unitary system; and (c) the Netherlands, a hybrid system with its federal–unitary democracy (Lijphart 1999). Section A (p. 1) in the Supplementary Information (SI) contains additional information on the political systems of the four countries. In accordance with their macro-political systems, network structures of Switzerland and Germany should belong to the same neighbourhood (Lubell et al. 2012). In these consensus democracies, we test whether networks display (a) a fragmented power structure; (b) dense, cooperative interaction patterns, in general, and among actors with diverging beliefs; and (c) a low degree of conflict. Due to their ‘opposite’ type of democratic system, French network structures should (a) concentrate power in the hands of a few actors, (b) display fewer but more competitive interaction patterns, and (c) exhibit a greater degree of conflict. The Dutch macro-political system is positioned between the two extremes of consensus and majoritarian democracies, so its network structures should also reflect a combination of these qualities. Table 1 provides a summary of the relationship between macro-political and network structures, and categorizes the four cases into the typology. Data We asked a total of 149 state and non-state actors in Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands to participate in our survey. Survey respondents included actors involved in defined policymaking processes based on the boundary-specification approaches by Laumann and Knoke (1987) (see additional information in Section B (p. 5) of the SI for further explanations on data gathering procedures). We chose policymaking processes related to pollutants of emerging concern in water, for example, pharmaceuticals. This issue was part of the political agenda in all four countries.1 Actors involved in formulating, advocating and selecting policies on emerging pollution issues in water protection were surveyed. Respondents include governmental bodies, scientific entities, political parties as well as water, environmental and economic associations. Response rates range from 89.2% for Switzerland, to 68.4% for Germany, 45.5% for France, and 50.5% for the Netherlands (response rates calculated after AAPOR 2011). The survey included questions on collaboration ties, ally-opponent ties and policy beliefs. Respondents received a complete list of country-specific actors and were asked to check all those with whom their organization had closely collaborated during the policymaking process on emerging pollutants in the respective timeframe. For each country, we created an 𝑛×𝑛 $n\times n$ adjacency matrix (N) of cooperation ties with n actors (values 0 indicating no cooperation tie and 1 indicating cooperation between two actors). Additionally, we surveyed each actor's consensual/conflictive interaction patterns through their ally/opponents ties. Allies (or opponents) correspond to actors with whom they agreed (disagreed) on policy content. The survey further included a question capturing actors' beliefs and instrument preferences on a four-point Likert scale (see Table S1 (p. 6) for the survey question on beliefs and Table S2 (p. 6) for the survey question on instruments of the SI). Figure 1 depicts the four collaboration networks. The Swiss network 𝑁 𝐶𝐻 $N_{CH}$ contains 47 unique nodes (i.e. actors) together with 253 directed edges (i.e. collaboration ties between actors), resulting in a network density of almost 12% ( 253/(47·46) $253/(47\cdot 46)$ ). The German policy network 𝑁 𝐷𝐸 $N_{DE}$ contains 29 actors and 121 edges (network density =15%). The French policy network 𝑁 𝐹𝑅 $N_{FR}$ contains 18 actors and 96 edges (network density =31%). Finally, the Dutch policy network 𝑁 𝑁𝐿 $N_{NL}$ contains 16 actors and 108 edges (network density =45%). Statistical Approach ERGMs We examine structural differences in the four policy networks using ERGM. The inherent dependencies among observations in network settings violate the core assumption of independence in conventional regression models. The violation of the independence assumption may result in biased estimates and optimistic p-values (Cranmer and Desmarais 2011; Cranmer et al. 2017). To overcome these potentials for inaccuracy, we use a statistical model that can handle and explicitly model dependencies. ERGMs are developed to estimate effects of both exogenous and endogenous covariates on network formation (Frank and Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007; Wasserman and Pattison 1996). The model can be expressed as the probability of observing the given network N over all possible permutations 𝒩 $\mathcal {N}$ of the network: 𝑃(𝑁,𝜃)= exp{ 𝜃 𝑇 ℎ(𝑁)} ∑ 𝑁 ∗ ∈𝒩 exp{ 𝜃 𝑇 ℎ( 𝑁 ∗ )} , \begin{equation} P(N, \pmb {\theta }) = \frac{\exp \lbrace \pmb {\theta }^T \pmb {h}(N) \rbrace }{\sum _{N^* \in \mathcal {N}} \exp \lbrace \pmb {\theta }^T \pmb {h}(N^*)\rbrace }, \end{equation} (1) where N is the observed network, 𝜃 $\pmb {\theta }$ represent the estimated parameters and ℎ(𝑁) $\pmb {h}(N)$ is a vector of statistics containing exogenous and endogenous covariates (Cranmer and Desmarais 2011). The ERGM can also be thought of as a logistic regression of tie formation, where the probability of observing a specific tie between two actors i and j is dependent on the specified changes in the ℎ(𝑁) $\pmb {h}(N)$ statistics (Desmarais and Cranmer 2012; Wasserman and Pattison 1996). 𝑃( 𝑁 𝑖𝑗 =1| 𝑁 −𝑖𝑗 ,𝜃)=𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖 𝑡 −1 (𝜃· 𝛿 (𝑖𝑗) (𝑁)), \begin{equation} P(N_{ij}=1|N_{-ij},\pmb {\theta }) = logit^{-1}{\left(\pmb {\theta }\cdot \pmb {\delta }^{(ij)}(N) \right)}, \end{equation} (2) where 𝑁 −𝑖𝑗 $N_{-ij}$ refers to the network excluding 𝑁 𝑖𝑗 $N_{ij}$ , logit−1 is the inverse logistic function and 𝛿 (𝑖𝑗) (𝑁) $\pmb {\delta }^{(ij)}(N)$ are the vector of change statistics for the vector of endogenous and exogenous covariate statistics such that they measure the changes in the statistics as dyad {i,j} changes from zero to one (Desmarais and Cranmer 2012, pp. 404–5). To allow the incorporation of endogenous network statistics into the model, the estimation of the ERGM is carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation (MCMC MLE) (Cranmer and Desmarais 2011; Wasserman and Pattison 1996). We use the ergm package (Hunter et al. 2008) in the statnet suit of packages (Handcock et al. 2008) for the statistical computing environment R to estimate the ERGMs. The inclusion of endogenous network statistics are bound to the assumption that all necessary statistics are modelled to prevent omitted variable bias (Cranmer et al. 2017). To ensure the sufficient inclusion of endogenous network statistics we perform goodness-of-fit tests for each of the models using the btergm package (Leifeld, Cranmer, and Desmarais 2018). Comparing Results Across Networks We run four separate ERGMs, one for each of the policy networks, and compare the effects of our independent variables across the models. To ensure comparability of the effects as well as their effect sizes, we use the micro-level interpretation of ERGM models that conceptualize ERGMs as a logistic regression of tie formation (Desmarais and Cranmer 2012). We calculate predicted probabilities over all dyads in the networks, using change statistics for all endogenous and exogenous variables and the estimated coefficients from the ERGMs, as proposed by Faust and Skvoretz (2002). Comparing structural properties across different networks proves challenging, as the number of nodes and the number of ties differ between each of the networks. The estimated coefficients of the ERGMs allow for an interpretation of which structural patterns or data-generating processes are discernible within one network. However, they do not allow for a direct comparison of coefficient sizes across different networks. This is because the coefficients are reported as log-odds and show relative risks, that is, the coefficients can be interpreted as the risk of having a cooperative tie between two actors compared to the risk of having no cooperative tie. These risks are dependent on network size and density. In order to compare the effects between different ERGMs, predicted probabilities can be calculated for each dyad (𝑖,𝑗) $(i, j)$ in the network. These predicted probabilities can be used at the dyad level to examine the probability that node i has a tie to node j conditional on the rest of the network (Faust and Skvoretz 2002). 𝑃𝑟({𝑖,𝑗}=1| 𝑁 −𝑖𝑗 )= exp( 𝜃 ̂ 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠 +ℎ( 𝑁 𝑖𝑗 )· 𝜃 ̂ ) (1+exp( 𝜃 ̂ 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠 +ℎ( 𝑁 𝑖𝑗 )· 𝜃 ̂ )) . \begin{equation} Pr(\lbrace i, j\rbrace = 1|N^{-ij}) = \frac{{\rm exp}(\hat{\theta }_{edges} + \pmb {h(N_{ij})}\cdot \pmb {\hat{\theta }})}{(1 + {\rm exp}(\hat{\theta }_{edges} + \pmb {h(N_{ij})}\cdot \pmb {\hat{\theta }}))}. \end{equation} (3) First, the odds of a dyad between nodes i and j is calculated using the baseline probability of a tie (captured in the 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒𝑠 $edges$ -term) plus the change statistic for each independent and control variable (here in the simplified notation ℎ( 𝑁 𝑖𝑗 ) $h(N_{ij})$ ) times the estimated coefficient of said variable (Faust and Skvoretz 2002, pp. 276–7). Then the odds are transformed into probabilities by dividing them by one plus the odds. The change statistic represents the difference in the value of the independent or control variable if the dyad (𝑖,𝑗) $(i, j)$ is toggled, that is, if the dyad (𝑖,𝑗) $(i, j)$ is transformed into an edge if it was previously a non-edge; or if the dyad (𝑖,𝑗) $(i, j)$ is transformed into a non-edge, if it was previously an edge. We use the btergm package (Leifeld, Cranmer, and Desmarais 2018) to calculate predicted probabilities that allow comparisons of effects between ERGMs. Operationalization of Variables We use a number of endogenous and exogenous variables to test our main hypotheses whilst controlling for a number of possibly confounding effects. Power Concentration Hypothesis 1 relates to power concentration and network centralization. We examine to which extent the four networks show centralized or decentralized tendencies by examining the indegree distribution of the network nodes. In centralized networks, coordination is dominated by few central actors and power is inherently concentrated, resulting in a distinct network structure of few high-indegree nodes and many low-indegree nodes. By contrast, in networks where power is more broadly distributed and shared, there are fewer high-indegree nodes and more nodes with similar numbers of incoming ties. We use a geometrically weighted indegree distribution term, presented by Hunter (2007) to model power concentration. The term captures tendencies of popular nodes (i.e. nodes with high indegree centrality) to disproportionally attract other nodes and become even more popular. More formally, the term creates a count of nodes with indegrees ranging from its minimum to its maximum: ℎ gwindegree = 𝑒 𝛼 ∑ 𝑚=1 𝑛−1 {1− (1− 𝑒 −𝛼 ) 𝑚 }𝐼𝐷𝑒 𝑔 𝑚 (𝑁), \begin{equation} h_\text{gwindegree} = e^{\alpha } \sum _{m=1}^{n-1} \lbrace 1-(1-e^{-\alpha })^m\rbrace IDeg_m(N), \end{equation} (4) where N refers to the Network, m represent indegree specifications ranging from 1 to the maximum indegree (in a network with n nodes, max(𝐼𝐷𝑒𝑔)=𝑛−1 ${\rm max}(IDeg) = n-1$ ) and α is a decay parameter used to scale down low indegree counts of high indegree nodes (Hunter 2007, p. 221). The higher the α-parameter, the more weight is given to changes to high-indegree nodes. To adequately model high-indegree nodes, we set a high α-parameter of 1.4 and compare model fit (using BIC scores) with other models with slightly higher or lower α-parameters. A negative coefficient for the geometrically weighted indegree distribution term indicates that the network is more centralized due to its large variance in the indegree distribution among the nodes (Levy 2016). The term can be interpreted as a popularity statistic that captures whether or not indegree is distributed equally among the nodes. In networks where the distribution is skewed, some nodes have high indegrees, that is, are popular nodes in the network. We expect power concentration – or network centralization – to play a role in all four policy networks. However, we expect the effect to be stronger in both the French and the Dutch policy network due to the nature of their unitary political system that favours centralization and gives a few actors the opportunity to hold strong positions to exercise power and marginalize opponents. To compare the effects of power concentration on the probability of forming ties, we calculate predicted probabilities for a random selection of nodes and with specific indegree levels. We use these predicted probabilities to assess the increase in the probability of forming a new tie, if the node has a high or low indegree centrality (following the framework of interpreting ERGMs at the dyad level, presented by Desmarais and Cranmer 2012). Interaction Patterns We test for differences in quantity and quality of interaction patterns. To capture quantity and account for whether interactions are close-knit versus sparse, we test for the overall level of clustering in the network. We include a triadic closure effect that examines the extent to which two nodes i and j become tied due to the number of additional partners k they share. We use a geometrically weighted term, presented by Hunter (2007, p. 224), to capture effects of triadic closure: ℎ 𝑔𝑤𝑒𝑠𝑝 = 𝑒 𝛼 ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑛−2 {1− (1− 𝑒 −𝛼 ) 𝑘 }𝐸 𝑃 𝑘 (𝑁), \begin{equation} h_{gwesp} = e^{\alpha } \sum _{k=1}^{n-2} \lbrace 1-(1-e^{-\alpha })^k\rbrace EP_k(N), \end{equation} (5) where N represents the network and 𝐸𝑃 $EP$ refers to the number of shared partners k that edges i, j have in common. The counts of shared partners for all edges in the network are summed up. The α-parameter is used to weigh the counts, with a α-value near 0 giving more weight to lower counts (i.e. number of edges with only one or two shared partners, for instance). We chose an α-parameter of 0.25 as it produced the best fit for the four network models based on BIC scores. The effect yields a positive coefficient if nodes have a tendency to close open triads and therefore form denser collaboration patterns. We expect to find a positive effect of triadic closure in consensus democracies, because such systems foster close-knit collaboration patterns. We also expect a smaller or nonexistent effect of triadic closure in majoritarian democracies, which institutionalize competitive relations. We use two variables to operationalize the quality of interactions and test whether interactions are cooperative versus competitive. First, edge covariate measures whether actors reach out towards opponents, that is, actors with whom they have a conflictual relationship: ℎ edgeCovariate = ∑ 𝑖,𝑗 𝑁 𝑖𝑗 𝑥 𝑖𝑗 , \begin{equation} h_\text{edgeCovariate} = \sum _{i, j} N_{ij}x_{ij}, \end{equation} (6) where N refers to the all edges in the focal network and x refers to the edge attribute pertaining to nodes i and j. A positive coefficient indicates that actors tend to collaborate with other actors despite their opposition. We expect to find a positive relationship in consensus democracies due to their inherent necessity to collaborate and overcome adversities and seek compromises across coalitions. Second, we test for belief dissimilarities among collaboration partners, which we operationalize with an absolute difference effect for weighted policy beliefs (see Section C (p. 5) in the SI for additional information and phrasing of the belief questions). The absolute difference effects were calculated by comparing the differences in answers for each of the five questions k: ℎ 𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓 = ∑ 𝑙 𝑘 |𝑥 (𝑘) 𝑖 −𝑥 (𝑘) 𝑗 | 𝑙 , \begin{equation} \nobreakspace h_{absdiff} = \frac{\sum _k^l | x(k)_i - x(k)_j |}{l}, \end{equation} (7) where k refers to the l belief questions and 𝑥(𝑘) $x(k)$ represents the value of question k for each respondent i and j. In the resulting dissimilarity matrices, higher values denote actors' belief dissimilarities. A negative coefficient in the ERGM indicates that strong belief dissimilarities among two nodes have a negative effect on the nodes' likelihood of forming a collaboration tie. In other words, the smaller the differences in beliefs between two actors, the more likely they are to work together. Based on insights from the multiple studies on advocacy coalitions and their applications in various political systems, we expect to find a negative effect of belief dissimilarities on collaboration in all four networks (Henry, Lubell, and McCoy 2011; Ingold 2011; Weible and Sabatier 2005). Nevertheless, we expect the effect to be stronger in majoritarian democracies, where cooperation and consensus-seeking among dissimilar actors is not institutionally encouraged as is the case for consensus democracies (Adam and Kriesi 2007; Kriesi, Adam, and Jochum 2006; Lijphart 1999). We further include an interaction effect for belief dissimilarities and collaboration with opponents to ensure that both variables do not confound each other in the model. Control Variables and Model Fit We control for a number of endogenous and exogenous variables to (a) account for additional factors affecting collaboration ties between policy actors, (b) ensure our effects for the independent variables do not suffer from omitted-variable bias and (c) stabilize our ERG models. Apart from the most basic control variable – network density – we control for reciprocity to account for the symmetric nature of collaboration ties (Berardo and Scholz 2010). We control for different activity and popularity effects of governmental actors as these actors are institutionally mandated to engage in a policy issue and are often approached by other actors, for example, to exchange information (König and Bräuninger 1998). We control for activity effects of important actors (i.e. actors with high reputational power) (Leifeld and Schneider 2012) and for instrument preference dissimilarity to strengthen our test of belief dissimilarities. We control for differences in reputational power as this term helped stabilize the ERGM of the Swiss case and did not affect the ERGM of the other three cases. Section D (p. 7) in the SI holds additional details along with specifications on our control variables. ERG models are only interpretable if they are well-specified (Cranmer et al. 2017). Figure 2 shows goodness-of-fit assessments of our models presented in the subsequent section. Together with the independent variables, the control variables help capture the data-generating process of each of the four policy networks well. We simulated 500 networks using the estimated parameters and compared their network properties to the original network (boxplots represent the values from simulated networks and black lines represent values from the original networks). We compare degree distributions, dyad-wise shared partners, incoming k-stars, geodesic distance and triadic closure for the observed and simulated networks. All networks show an acceptable fit with the small exception of incoming k-stars for the Swiss network.2 We further check whether tie prediction in the simulated networks is accurate using receiver-operating curves (see far right panels in Figure 2). All curves are well above the curves including exogenous variables only, which indicates good fit and predictive power, and allows for a substantive interpretation of the model coefficients. Results Figure 3 reports the results of the four ERGMs on tie formation. Power We test our first hypothesis on power-sharing by examining the degree of centralization of the four policy networks. As is expected in policy networks, all networks exhibit negative and significant popularity effects, demonstrating skewed indegree distributions. To examine the effect in more detail, we calculate the (relative) probability of adding an additional tie for a randomly selected node to a node with a specified indegree. Figure 4 shows the increase in the probability of a tie when an additional incoming tie is added to a node. Both the Swiss and German networks show slowly increasing probabilities, with an additional incoming tie increasing a node's attractiveness by only a few percentage points. In the unitary French and Dutch systems, networks show much steeper increases in popularity effects (as well as overall higher probabilities of tie-creation, controlled for overall network density) that tailor off only after six existing incoming ties. Results indicate higher levels of power concentration in the French and Dutch cases than in the Swiss and German federal systems that prioritize power fragmentation. Interaction Patterns To test our hypothesis 2 on the quantity of interactions, we examine the density of collaboration ties by studying triadic closure. The Swiss, German and French networks exhibit a strong tendency towards triadic closure, and therefore also close-knit collaboration patterns, whereas the Dutch network exhibits no tendency towards triadic closure. We test our hypothesis 2 on the quality of interactions by means of two operationalizations: collaboration with named opponents and collaboration across belief dissimilarities. The term for collaboration with opponents is highly significant and positive in the Swiss and German networks, non-significant in the French network and weakly significant and positive in the Dutch case. The term should be interpreted as a correlation between naming someone as a collaboration partner and naming someone as an opponent. Actors in Switzerland and Germany have a strong tendency to collaborate with others with whom they disagree. The effect appears weaker in the Dutch network. Deepening the ERGM results, Figure 5 shows that edge probabilities for actors to create ties with opponents are comparable among the Swiss, German and Dutch case as their confidence intervals overlap, indicating non-significant differences between the three cases. Accordingly, Dutch, followed by German and Swiss actors have a strong tendency to collaborate with others with whom they also disagree. Section E Figure S4 (p. 14) in the SI shows the results of a detailed analysis of cooperation with governmental and non-governmental opponents. The probability of collaborating with an opponent is driven in the Swiss and German cases by collaborations with governmental actors, which is not true for the Dutch case. The French network contains few mentions of opponents (see Figure S1 (p. 10) in the SI) resulting in large confidence intervals for predicted probabilities (not shown). Results indicate that there are fewer opponents in the French case. Rather than exhibiting several opposing coalitions, the French network structure resembles one large majority coalition within which intensive collaboration takes place. Our second operationalization of the quality of interactions captures collaboration among actors who hold opposing beliefs. Figure 6 (left panel) shows descriptives of the dissimilarities regarding policy beliefs among two collaborating actors. French members have a significantly lower mean compared to the other three cases (Two-sample t-test, mean CH, DE and NL =0.83, mean FR =0.68, 𝑡=3.06 $t = 3.06$ , p-value =0.003), indicating stronger belief similarities among collaboration partners in the French case compared to those of the Swiss, German or Dutch. Results in Figure 3 (reporting the coefficients of the absolute difference effects), as well as the marginal effects of belief differences on collaboration in Figure 6 (right panel), affirm the comparably stronger belief similarities in the French case. Results of the ERGM in Figure 3 show that only the French coefficients are significant and negative for belief dissimilarities. As belief dissimilarities between pairs of actors increase, their odds of forming a collaboration tie decrease when holding all other independent and control variables constant. In the Swiss, German and Dutch cases, by contrast, belief dissimilarities do not impact collaboration patterns. In those consensus democracies, network members collaborate with belief-similar and dissimilar others. Figure 6 (right panel) depicts a more fine-grained interpretation of the belief differences and their correlation with cooperative ties for the French network (single significant effect in the ERGM). The marginal effect exhibits a slightly curved relationship, where the probability of a tie decreases, as differences in policy beliefs increase, and then trails off. The confidence intervals are large and spread across the zero-line (which reflects the baseline probability of a tie for the network). Controls We controlled for a number of effects to ensure the models have a good fit and the independent variables are not confounded. Regarding instrument preference dissimilarity, the Swiss and French cases show negative effects, indicating that actors with the same instrument preferences are more likely to work together. Unsurprisingly, reciprocity has a strong positive effect in all four networks, which indicates that reciprocity is stronger for the observed networks than for the random networks with all other variables held constant. Actors who nominate other actors as collaboration partners are often named as partners themselves. Governmental actors are slightly more popular in France – reflecting French etatism – and actors who are regarded as important by network members are also more active (have higher outdegree centrality). Section D (p. 7) in the SI interprets results for the control variables in more detail. Discussion Results that test our hypothesis 1 show that power generally matters in policy networks. In a political context, it is not a surprising finding that actors tend to collaborate with others whom they consider powerful. Our data additionally indicate that the popularity effect is stronger in the French and Dutch unitarian systems where higher levels of power concentration occur than in the Swiss and German federal systems that diffuse power. With Hypothesis 2, we first tested whether actors are more likely to exhibit close-knit interaction patterns in consensus democracies than in majoritarian democracies. We expected our French instance of a majoritarian democracy to exhibit a less dense network (in terms of triadic closure) than those of Switzerland and Germany; however, this was not the case. Reflecting the more competitive nature of the French political system, the French network exhibits only a few mentions of opponents. Opponents are less integrated into the policymaking process than is the case for the Swiss, German and Dutch networks. The existing, dense collaborative patterns take place among actors who generally agree on policy content rather than as a result of a consensus-finding mechanism across coalitions of opposing actors. Secondly, we tested whether interactions tend to be more cooperative in consensus than in majoritarian democracies. Our results confirm that in the consensus democracies of Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands, there is a high probability of establishing a tie with opponents. Governmental actors are driving consensus-seeking interactions (in the Swiss and German case). These results indicate that institutionalized arenas for exchange exist and create opportunities for the creation of dense interaction patterns with opponents. Overall, results for interactions with opponents follow the pattern of Lijpharts typology of democracies, according to which German and Swiss consensual–federal systems are diametrically opposed to the French majoritarian–unity democracy, whereas the Dutch consensual–unitary democracy represents a hybrid of the two system types. Moreover, we operationalized cooperative ties by testing for the effect of belief dissimilarities on interactions. Results follow theory, whereby belief dissimilarities have no significant effect on collaboration in the Swiss, German and Dutch consensus democracies. Results also support our expectations for the French majoritarian democracy, where actors who display dissimilar beliefs are less likely to collaborate. Results show that, in consensus democracies, activities in political policymaking processes are largely contingent upon finding common ground with opponents and across belief dissimilarities. In summary, political systems provide opportunity structures for the emergence of specific patterns of ties in policy networks. Notwithstanding these results, some limitations should be noted. In line with Lijpharts map of democracies, our analysis treats Switzerland and Germany as instances of the same category. However, significant differences exist concerning the role of consensus procedures and power sharing in politics (see Section A (p. 1) in the SI for a characterization of the political system of the four countries), which should affect network structures. For example, Swiss consensus mechanisms are particularly strong. Swiss opposition parties are also institutionally more integrated into the executive branch than are German opposition parties (Vatter 2014; Von Beyme 2010). Moreover, domain specificities can structure policy networks (Brockhaus and Di Gregorio 2014; John and Cole 2000; Wagner et al. 2021). Therefore, we emphasize that results should be regarded as neighbourhoods of networks, that is, structures that allow for further within-case variation. Our survey response rates vary between the four cases: 89.2% for Switzerland, 68.4% for Germany, 50.5% for the Netherlands and 45.5% for France. Although our inferential analysis of the four network structures ensures comparability across different network sizes and densities (through examining micro-level interpretations of ERGM coefficients), different response rates can nevertheless distort our analysis. In network studies, non-responses can occur if respondents are only indirectly involved and consider their own participation as irrelevant. We tested whether actors who did not participate in the survey were also less often named as collaboration partners. In all four cases, the average indegree of non-respondents was markedly smaller than that of respondents (with significant t-tests in France and the Netherlands). This outcome is a small indication that those actors involved in the policy process indeed responded to our survey in all four cases, giving some certainty to our results. Nonetheless, it is still possible that differences in response rates affect our inferential results. We further tested whether our inferential network results remain stable if data are removed. We chose the Swiss network for this experiment and re-ran the ERGM for the Swiss network by removing 5, 10, 15 and 20 random nodes from the network and re-estimating the ERGM. Results are presented in Section F (p. 15) of the SI and show that key features of the network hold up, even if nodes are removed. This test is not definitive, but rather an indication that differences in response rates do not gravely affect results (Schaub and Metz 2020). We look towards future studies comparing policy networks across different political systems to strengthen our results. Conclusion First, our analysis has revealed that political systems systematically shape policy networks (Lubell et al. 2012) by enabling and constraining actors ability for power concentration and cooperation. These findings suggest that policymaking is not merely determined by actors steering capacity, but also by the institutional structures in which actors behave (Daugbjerg and Marsh 1998). The institutional context conditions actors behaviour within the network by facilitating and constraining negotiations across political camps. Comprehending such impact of institutions on policy networks is decisive for democratic and successful policymaking (Fischer 2017). Second, and contrary to what one would expect, we found that our cases of water policy networks in consensus democracies were more conflictual and less densely connected than their majoritarian counterpart. Our explanation is that consensus democracies are open to a heterogeneous set of actors, which also allows room for conflict. By contrast, majoritarian democracies create clear, homogenous majorities. Actors tend to collaborate within their political camp, which provides less room for conflict, but may impede productive exchanges of policy ideas, deliberation and learning. These findings bear some interesting policy implications: In the daily business of policymaking, it may be tedious to confront a heterogenous set of actors and search for compromise across political camps in consensus democracies. Such efforts nevertheless pay off in the long-term as a culture of compromise-seeking establishes, which promotes effective and generally accepted policy outputs. This is precisely what we observed in our cases. For example, the German Federal Environmental Agency reported to us that broad integration of actors across camps led to a dilution of the policy to some extent. Nevertheless, a legally binding policy was adopted, which constituted a first step towards increased water protection. By contrast, in our French case, an ambitious, but legally non-binding policy plan was adopted. Its implementation remains uncertain. The French Ministry of Ecology reported to us that it was typical to adopt policy plans (instead of legally binding laws) in French environmental policy. This strategy may serve to avoid confrontation with the political opponent, but it also impedes the search for generally accepted policy proposals. Results highlight that differences between network structures can affect policy outputs. To then better understand the reasons for which certain political systems perform better in terms of producing policy outputs and policy change, future research is needed that systematically links network structures to policy outputs (Metz 2017). A promising research agenda could focus on institutions that promote collaboration and consensus-finding with the political opponent, particularly in majoritarian democracies. Third, results confirm what previous network studies have concluded and according to which there is not one single way how a policy network operates (Leifeld and Schneider 2012, p. 742). We have suggested that networks operate differently across political systems. Most policy network studies, however, are case studies that focus on one country (Baumgartner and Leech 1996; Fischer 2017) and neglect the institutional context, thereby excluding a major explanatory variable. To explain variation in policy outcomes across countries, one can hardly ignore the broader institutional context (Daugbjerg and Marsh 1998, p. 54). We therefore propose that future studies should take the political system into account when analysing policy networks. We contribute to the advancement of the literature on policy networks with a model that identifies those aspects of macro-political architecture that fundamentally shape the structure of policy networks. Our model can be considered a baseline in order to distinguish typical from atypical network structures given their embeddedness into a political system. Studying the atypical will prove particularly valuable to understand domain-specific differences, or, with longitudinal data, the effect of regime change, new governance arrangements and shocks on decision making over time. Finally, we recognize the utility and limitations of conceptualizing policy processes as networks. One cannot explain variation in policy outcomes by simply referencing the structures of policy networks (Daugbjerg and Marsh 1998, p. 71). Nevertheless, understanding why networks take the form they do given their embeddedness into a political system is key to better understanding the social context upon which policy content is agreed."
16,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA03-2022-AJPS.txt," Previous research has established that men are more likely to vote for populist radical right parties (PRRPs) than women. This article shows how cross-national and temporal variations in PRRPs’ electoral success interact with individuals’ risk propensity to affect this gender gap. We hypothesize that gender differences in the electoral support of PRRPs stem from disparities in risk-taking. We conceptualize risk in terms of two components, social and electoral, and demonstrate that women are more risk-averse regarding both. Our analysis is based on public opinion data from 14 countries (2002–16) combined with macrolevel data on PRRPs’ past parliamentary fortunes. To distinguish between the social and electoral components in risk-taking, we use the illustrative case study of Germany. Findings demonstrate that gender differences in risk-taking and, by implication, the differences between women's and men's responses to the electoral context are key to understanding the voting gender gap. Populist radical right parties (PRRPs) in Western democracies have consistently garnered more electoral support from men than from women (Akkerman and Hagelund 2007; Givens 2004, 2005). This gap has been described as “a complex and intriguing puzzle” (Betz 1994, 146) since no comparably consistent gender differences have emerged regarding immigration and minority-integration policies, which are pivotal in the PRRPs’ electoral campaigning (Harteveld and Ivarsflaten 2018). Several studies have explored the gender gap in the support for PRRPs and the above puzzle related to it (e.g., Gidengil et al. 2005; Givens 2004; Spierings and Zaslove 2015). However, to the best of our knowledge, no research into this subject has systematically factored in the electoral context and its effects on vote choices of men and women as possible elements that elucidate the wider picture. This article joins a growing group of scholars in arguing that the electoral success of PRRPs can be explained based on the interplay of demand- and supply-side factors (Van Kessel 2015). Regarding the electoral gender gap, we contend that the explanation does not lie solely in voters’ characteristics but also involves party-specific qualities and voters’ perceptions of and responses to them. Namely, we focus on PRRPs’ past electoral fortunes (or lack thereof) as criteria for risk assessment on the part of voters in choosing a party. We contend that the decision to vote for a PRRP is contingent on an individual's propensity for risk-taking, which is known to be gendered. Following this rationale, we show how demand and supply factors interact and translate differently with the electoral behavior of men and women. We propose a theoretical framework to explain the observed difference in the electoral support for PRRPs among men versus women and then apply it to a large sample of voters. We maintain that for an individual, voting for a PRRP is fraught with a certain degree of risk. Not only are these parties comparatively unknown entities with limited parliamentary experience at best, but they also challenge the certainties of the existing political order (Steenbergen and Siczek 2017). Consequently, we expect that risk-averse voters will shun them during elections. We establish that women are more risk-averse than men on two dimensions. First, when political behavior is concerned, women tend more than men to avoid voting for parties that have no chance of winning seats in parliament, as a case in point, many of the PRRPs; and second, with regard to socially acceptable behavior, women are less prone than men to translate their extreme ideological positions to vote choice. That said, we argue that the risk of voting for PRRPs varies depending on the electoral context. When PRRPs’ prospects to (re)enter parliament are high, the decision to vote for these parties is less risky, both electorally and socially: electorally because in such circumstances, voting for these parties would not be tantamount to wasting one's vote; socially because when a PRRP has previously been supported by a large enough portion of the electorate, it can be perceived as a normative political player. Therefore, it stands to reason that the differentiated effect of risk propensity, both electoral and social, on the vote of men and women should manifest more strongly specifically in risky situations, when PRRPs are marginalized. To test our arguments, we use data from the European Social Survey (2002–16) in a set of 14 democracies, combined with electoral data on past achievements of PRRPs. Based on individual-level analysis, we find that women's ideological positions and risk-taking propensities are different from men's and that both these tendencies translate to a disparity in their vote choices. Moreover, to the extent that women are more sensitive to risk than men, this differentiated effect is augmented in what we will term a “risky political context,” that is, a situation when voting for PRRPs entails the risk of “wasting” one's vote. Next, we differentiate between the two explanations proposed here for the gender gap in voting for PRRPs—that is, women's propensity for risk aversion, both social and electoral—which may be observationally equivalent in a comparative context. To this end, we use the possibility afforded by the German electoral system to cast two separate votes, one for a candidate and the other for a party list, as a tool to distinguish between electoral and social risk. Overall, findings from the cross-national analysis and the German case study fully align with our theoretical expectations. Women's proneness to avoid risk is manifested not only in their ideological positions and reported risk-taking propensities but also in their sensitivity to the risks presented by a given political context. These findings highlight important interrelations between individual characteristics and the party-specific political supply side, and they carry far-reaching implications for the study of the fluctuations in the popularity of PRRPs in Western democracies. The Gender Gap in Voting for PRRPs: Existing Explanations Empirical studies have repeatedly demonstrated that PRRPs have a larger male constituency (Akkerman and Hagelund 2007; Givens 2004, 2005; Spierings and Zaslove 2015; Van der Brug and Fennema 2007) but have diverged in their accounts of this finding. One set of explanations focuses on gender differences in preferences and attitudes, which are supposed to lead women to vote for other parties. Harteveld and Ivarsflaten (2018) found that women are more motivated than men to control prejudice and therefore refrain from voting for PRRPs, which often resort to extremist or even fascist rhetoric and thus raise normative concerns about discrimination and prejudice. Other explanations revolve around gender differences in personality traits and populist attitudes. Thus, Coffé (2019) shows that masculine personality traits are positively correlated with voting for PRRPs, and Spierings and Zaslove (2017) make a case for the salience of populist attitudes in this respect. Another line of inquiry attributes the gap to men's and women's different structural positions in the labor market. According to this account, the anti-immigrant sentiment of PRRPs is framed to appeal to those harmed by globalization, usually blue-collar male workers whose jobs have been jeopardized by the influx of immigrant laborers (Betz 1994; Givens 2004; Norris 2005). Yet another explanation for the gender gap appeals to the anti-feminist agenda promoted by many of the PRRPs. Most of these parties hold a traditional view of women's roles and the family model, and many are characterized by a hierarchical and male-dominated structure (Mudde 2019). This account, however, had not been borne out empirically and was therefore discarded. Specifically, Spierings and Zaslove (2015), as well as De Koster (2014), show that neither gender-role attitudes nor moral progressiveness has much to do with either voting for PRRPs or the attendant gender gap. Recent studies have suggested that the dynamics of PRRPs’ electoral success and of the gender gap therein are contingent on the interaction between the demand- and supply-side factors. An examination of these aspects, the argument goes, would supplement the existing explanations and afford a comprehensive understanding of the political picture (Van Kessel 2015). Some studies (Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser 2015; Spierings and Zaslove 2017) have addressed supply-side differences across countries at the system level. Spierings, Lubbers, and Zaslove (2017) extend this approach by modeling macrolevel factors indicative of the supply of PRRPs and show that the likelihood of voting for PRRPs depends on the specific characteristics of a party and the presence of other right-wing parties in the arena. Apart from this work, supply-side explanations for the gender gap in voting for PRRPs have not yet been rigorously modeled systematically or statistically. Nevertheless, Spierings, Lubbers, and Zaslove's work (2017) bolsters our case that supply involves more than party positions. Therefore, when examining the supply side, it is crucial to incorporate other factors, such as the electoral context. Accordingly, we account for the gender gap through a combination of demand-side factors pertaining to trait differences between the sexes and supply-side parameters anchored in the electoral context in which PRRPs compete.1 Building on the existing literature, this article advances a novel explanation for the gender gap in electoral support for PRRPs. Our argument is based on the well-established gender differences in risk propensity, which we bring to bear on the electoral arena. The model we set forth here predicts that the gender gap in the vote for PRRPs will be attenuated in the wake of a mainstreaming of the populist radical right, a process currently underway in Western countries. Gender Differences in Risk-Taking, Risk Aversion, and Risk Perception Our argument hinges on the notion that under certain conditions, voting for a PRRP can present a risk. Risk is commonly predicated of situations in which individuals must make decisions or choices involving different alternatives with uncertain future consequences (Schubert 2006, 706). The act of risk-taking, that is, making a risky choice, involves two components, risk tolerance (i.e., risk aversion or acceptance) and risk perception (i.e., the subjective assessment of risk). In what follows, we elaborate on these three constructs and their links to gender. Numerous studies have established robust gender differences in risk-taking behaviors, with women generally taking fewer risks than men. The idea that men are more likely to take risks than women is supported by a meta-analysis of 150 studies in psychology specifically addressing gender gaps in risk-taking tendencies (Byrnes, Miller, and Schafer 1999). Studies in economics, ranging from lab experiments to field observations, report similar conclusions (Eckel and Grossman 2008; Sunden and Surette 1998). Gender differences in risk-taking behaviors can be attributed to differences in risk aversion, risk perception, or both. Risk aversion (or its flip side, risk acceptance) is often conceptualized as a personality trait and, as such, interfaces with other related Big Five traits such as Extroversion and Openness (Kam 2012). Risk aversion is contingent on an individual's tendency toward sensation seeking, which is “a trait defined by the seeking of varied, novel, complex, and intense sensations and experiences, and the willingness to take physical, social, legal, and financial risks for the sake of such experience” (Zuckerman 1994, 27). As a personality trait, risk aversion is conceived of as a stable predisposition and is not issue or case specific (Nicholson et al. 2005; Weinstein and Martin 1969). Women have been shown to be generally more risk-averse than men. Evidence to that effect comes from a variety of fields, including psychology and economics. Kam (2012), for example, documented gender differences in risk attitudes based on a large battery of survey questions. Wilson and Daly (1985, 61) went so far as to describe the trait of risk tolerance as “an attribute of the masculine psychology.” Risk perception is the subjective judgment that people make about the characteristics and severity of a risk. Extant literature grounds risk perception in two psychological models. The risk-and-return model assumes that individuals weigh the perceived returns (or benefits) of a given action against its perceived risks (or costs) and are open to a trade-off between those costs and benefits (Kam 2012). The risk-as-feelings model (e.g., Slovic and Peters 2006; Slovic 2010) frames risk perception as highly dependent on the way individuals intuit a situation. Studies of risk perception have overwhelmingly found that men seem to be less concerned about hazards than women (Slovic 2010). Based on 25 hazard studies, Flynn, Slovic, and Mertz (1994) have shown that men perceived risks to be smaller than did women. Some studies suggest that gender differences in risk-taking are based on emotional reactions to risky situations. Whereas women tend to focus on the negative side of a risky situation's outcome distribution and perceive such a scenario as a threat, men often interpret risky situations as challenges requiring their involvement (Arch 1993; Ehrlich and Maestas 2010; Steenbergen and Siczek 2017). The Gendered Implications of a Risk Associated with Voting for a PRRP Previous studies have established a relationship between voters’ tendencies in perceiving and tolerating risk and their political choices and behavior (e.g., Eckles and Schaffner 2011; Ehrlich and Maestas 2010; Kam 2012; Kam and Simas 2010; Nadeau, Martin, and Blais 1999). Some studies have argued that one's risk aversion affects one's vote choice because voting is regarded as a gamble (Kam and Simas 2012, 747). More specifically, findings show that risk-averse voters are less likely to support challenger candidates over incumbents (Eckles et al. 2014; Kam and Simas 2012), opposition parties over governing parties (Morgenstern and Zechmeister 2001), and change over the status quo (Morisi 2018; Steenbergen and Siczek 2017). Based on the above research, we develop a theory that connects gender differences in risk-taking with the gender gap associated with voting for PRRPs. We argue that voting for PRRPs is a risky behavior, both electorally and socially, and therefore one's decision to vote for these parties is governed, to a large extent, by one's levels of risk aversion. We further elaborate how risk aversion will be mostly manifested in risky electoral contexts, such that women will perceive such a situation as riskier than men and will behave (vote) accordingly. Electoral Risk in Voting for PRRPs Voters may construe voting for PRRPs as electorally risky for two main reasons. First, PRRPs are usually challenger parties with little parliamentary experience relative to other party families. Not all of them have gained parliamentary representation, and the conduct of most of those that have done so is rather unpredictable (Steenbergen and Siczek 2017). Moreover, PRRPs question the status quo and campaign against the political establishment—an agenda that some voters undoubtedly find appealing but others may consider as risky. Thus, the risk that PRRPs pose on account of their conduct, goals, and priorities may deter risk-averse voters, who are usually inclined to avoid challenger and inexperienced parties or candidates (Eckles et al. 2014; Kam and Simas 2012). Second, voters may fear that they would “waste” their vote if the party they voted for did not eventually make it into parliament. Withholding a vote for a ""risky” party on such grounds is subsumed in the literature under the category of strategic voting. Whereas nonstrategic voters cast a vote for the party/candidate they choose on substantive grounds, irrespective of other considerations, strategic voters take into account the possible outcome of their voting decision (Abramson 2010; Cox 1997). When voting strategically, individuals will vote for a second-best party/candidate if their most preferred option is perceived as non-viable. Therefore, to act strategically, voters must have an assessment of a party's electoral viability. Lago (2008) argues that voters make such assessments based on history heuristics, whereby a party's viability depends on whether it has won seats in parliament in the past. As already mentioned, many PRRPs are new challenger parties that have not yet garnered sufficient electoral support to win a seat in parliament. Therefore, voting for these parties poses an electoral risk for voters, who fear they would “waste” their vote on a party that will not eventually make it into parliament. Given the robust, well-documented gender gap in risk aversion, as well as the electoral risk PRRPs present in the eyes of voters, we hypothesize that risk aversion mediates the effect of gender on voting for PRRPs as follows: H1: Risk-averse voters are less inclined to vote for PRRPs. As women are more risk-averse than men, they are less inclined to vote for PRRPs. Next, we contend that the likelihood of voting for PRRPs depends not only on the degree of one's risk aversion but also on one's assessment of the risk associated with such a choice. While we do not directly measure the perceived risk of voting for a PRRP, we argue that this perception is affected by the electoral context in which voting decisions are made: A risky context will lead to a greater perceived risk among women since they are more sensitive than men to risky situations. In the case in point, a risky electoral context involves PRRPs that have yet to win a seat in parliament. Voters may consider such PRRPs as riskier for the following two reasons: (a) they are viewed as less predictable or less stable, and (b) they lack previous electoral success to build on or replicate in the ensuing elections. As already stated, the literature on risk perception shows that women are more concerned than men about hazards and focus on the negative side of a risky situation's outcome distribution. That is, given the same objective conditions, women often perceive a situation as riskier than men do. As a result, we anticipate that in a risky electoral context, gender will moderate the effect of risk aversion on vote choice, as women will be more sensitive to PRRPs’ past electoral success: H2: In risky electoral contexts, risk-averse women are less likely to vote for PRRPs compared to risk-averse men. Political Extremism: The Social Risk of Voting for PRRPs Voting for PRRPs can also be considered as a social risk, due to their usually extreme and radical platforms. As inherent challengers, PRRPs fundamentally defy key institutions and values of liberal democracy, including minority rights and separation of powers (Mudde 2019). Such extreme ideological positions may deter voters who tend to conform with social norms. Though the act of voting is private, voters incorporate social norms into their electoral decisions, which are in consequence affected by social cues and parties’ reputation (Harteveld et al. 2019). Our theoretical argument, elaborated below, is that voting for a PRRP is associated with the risk of diverging from social conventions and prevailing opinions. Since women and men differ in risk-taking tendencies, the electoral consequences of such social risk will be different for each gender. Emerging literature connects social personality traits with support for PRRPs. For instance, Bakker, Rooduijn, and Schumacher (2016) show that a low score on Agreeableness, a trait that relates to higher levels of pro-social behaviors, predicts voting for populist parties. Studies by Blinder, Ford, and Ivarsflaten (2013) and by Harteveld and Ivarsflaten (2018) show that people who are highly motivated to control prejudice are less likely to support extreme right parties. The latter study highlights the implication of this finding for the gender gap in voting for PRRPs: Even when they hold stereotypic attitudes or beliefs, women are more inclined to control them based on socially driven norms anchored in anti-prejudice principles. Moreover, the social risk of voting for PRRPs is likely to be more salient for women, as they may incur harsher criticism than men when displaying rebellious or extreme behavior. Thus, Harteveld et al. (2019) show that women are less likely than men to vote for small, extreme, or socially stigmatized parties. In parallel to the influence of electoral risk, we expect the effect of social risk on voting for PRRPs to be contingent on these parties’ electoral status. Put simply, not all PRRPs are equally socially risky to vote for. In this article, we focus on PRRPs’ reputation in terms of their previous electoral parliamentary experience. Thus, voting for PRRPs that have never gained parliamentary representation poses a greater social risk since these parties do not bear a stamp of stability or acceptance (Valentim 2021). Following this rationale, we expect women's lower rate of support for PRRPs to be connected to their lower tendency to translate extreme political attitudes to political behavior, that is, voting for PRRPs. Like the previous hypothesis, this assumption rests on the premise that women perceive a greater social risk of voting for PRRPs in risky situations than men. In such an electoral context, a man will be more likely to translate his extreme right ideological position to voting for PRRPs than a woman who holds the same extreme position. We hypothesize that in a risky electoral context, gender will moderate the effect of ideological extremism on vote choice: H3: In a risky electoral context, ideological extremism affects women's vote for PRRPs less strongly than men's. Empirical Strategy Data and Measurement This study draws on three sources of data. At the individual level, we utilize all eight waves of the European Social Survey (ESS) between 2002 and 2016, with a total of 75 country-years. We also employ the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) data (Modules 4 and 5) to analyze strategic voting in Germany. We supplement these data with macrolevel variables tapping the changing electoral fortunes of PRRPs. In keeping with the idea that gender differences in political behavior are affected by culture, we limit our analyses to Western European countries. The countries and the populist radical right parties included in the analysis are presented in Table A1 in the supporting information (SI; p. 4). Dependent Variable Vote Choice This variable was gauged using the question, “Which party did you vote for in the last election?”2 Respondents’ vote choices were sorted into party families (see SI Appendix B, p. 8, for details on the sources we used to classify parties into families). We proceeded by focusing on the populist radical right. The dependent variable is a dummy variable, where 1 denotes respondents’ vote for PRRPs and 0 otherwise. Main Predictors PRRPs’ Electoral Strength and Parliamentary History To operationalize PRRPs’ electoral strength, we employed the following three measures: (1) a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if these parties had ever entered parliament in the past; (2) PRRPs’ vote share in the last national election preceding the survey; and (3) the share of seats in the national legislature, determined at the last national election preceding the survey. Measure 1 relates to Lago's (2008) argument regarding the heuristics voters rely on, and Measures 2 and 3 have been frequently used to capture strategic voting in studies focusing on far-right parties (Cohen 2020). Risk Aversion Previous studies proved that a general item outperforms other measures in predicting risky behavior across a wide range of areas in life (Dohmen 2011). Accordingly, as has been used extensively in political science (e.g., Margalit and Shayo 2020; Nadeau, Martin, and Blais 1999; Steenbergen and Siczek 2017), we measured individuals’ risk aversion utilizing a single item. Participants were presented with a description of a person (“She/he looks for adventures and likes to take risks”) and asked to indicate, on a scale of 1 to 6, to what extent the person described was like them, with higher values indicating higher risk aversion. Consistent with the literature on risk aversion, this item correlates with age and gender (partial r = 0.31, partial r = −0.14, p < .01 for both). Left–Right Self-Placement Individuals’ ideological self-placement was measured on an 11-point self-placement ideology scale (0 = left, 10 = right). Control Variables We controlled for a set of sociodemographic and attitudinal variables including age, gender, education, unemployment, and whether respondents are foreign-born. Additionally, we controlled for two indicators that are often mentioned as explanations for PRRP support: trust in politicians and political interest. Studies have shown that the rise of PRRPs in European democracies is associated with a growing public alienation from the political elites—a process that has frequently been manifested as protest votes against mainstream politicians and political parties (Inglehart and Norris 2017). The item gauging trust in politicians was rated on a scale ranging from 0, “no trust at all,” to 10, “complete trust” (M = 3.9; SD = 2.3). Political interest was measured using the item “How would you assess your interest in politics?” rated on a 4-point scale (reverse-coded so that higher values denote greater interest in politics; M = 2.5; SD = 2.3). Additionally, we included two anti-immigrant scales (economic and cultural anti-immigrant attitudes, respectively) created based on five items available from the ESS. These scales are described in detail in the SI (note to SI Figure C1, p. 25). Consistent with the literature, the distribution of the two anti-immigrant scales for the two sexes emerged as similar, and no significant differences were documented between genders. Models and Estimation The empirical analysis follows four trajectories. First, we establish descriptive differences in risk aversion and ideological self-placement between genders. This is followed by two sets of regression models. In the first set of models, we (re)establish the gender gap in voting for PRRPs and show the relationship between risk aversion and vote choice. These models involved pooled data for both risky and non-risky contexts. The results informed the second set of models, which examined whether men and women behave differently in risky contexts. Accordingly, the second set of models comprises probit regressions to predict the probabilities for female and male respondents, respectively, to choose PRRPs over other parties based on the former's past electoral achievements. These cross-level interaction models reveal a larger gender gap in risky contexts, indicating that the gender gap in the electoral support for PRRPs is rooted in risk-related attitudes and perceptions. Third, we test the differential gendered effects of ideological extremism and risk aversion on vote choice. To that end, we interact risk aversion and ideological extremism with gender. The analyses are performed on both the pooled data and in contexts where voting for PRRPs is fraught with risk, in accordance with the second and third hypotheses, respectively. In light of our theoretical premises, we would expect that risk-averse and ideologically extremist female voters will refrain to a greater extent from supporting the radical right. Importantly, we would expect a larger differentiated effect in risky electoral contexts. The fourth trajectory situates the analysis in Germany, where the possibility of vote splitting provides a tool to distinguish between the electoral risk and social risk as explanatory mechanisms for the gender gap. Results Risk Aversion, Political Extremism, and the Vote for PRRPs We begin with Figure 1, documenting descriptive differences in risk aversion and political extremity between women and men.3 The left-hand panel shows differences between women's and men's self-perception in terms of seeking adventures and risks, with more men than women reporting high risk propensity. Women are 1.5 times more likely than men to indicate that the description in the item described above is not at all like them (category 6). On this item, men score on average 3.7 (SD = 1.38), whereas women score 4.1 (SD = 1.4). The right-hand panel shows that, compared to men, women have a lower tendency to hold extreme political attitudes. On average, more women than men locate themselves at the center of the left–right ideological dimension. As already explained, even for voters who are ideologically positioned at the extremes, we expect the social risk of voting for PRRPs to act as a deterrent, and especially so for those more sensitive to risk, that is, women. Although we do not hypothesize about compositional differences in political extremity between genders, patterns documented in Figure 1 align with this social risk perspective. Since women are socialized to conformity and to abiding by existing norms, they are more likely than men to position themselves at the center and less likely at the extreme right.4 Thus far, we have documented compositional gender differences, showing that men are on average positioned ideologically to the right of women and that they are more risk-tolerant. Next, to investigate the effect of risk aversion on the gender gap in voting for PRRPs, we estimate probit models, presented in Table 1. All models include respondents’ demographic background and attitudinal variables, as well as country and year fixed effects (full models are presented in SI Table C1, p. 9). Model 1, with only gender on the right-hand side, confirms the gender gap documented in the literature, such that men are overrepresented among the populist radical right electorate. Model 2 adds risk aversion. The negative and significant coefficient obtained shows that risk-averse voters are less prone to support the populist radical right. In Model 2, although the decline in the gender coefficient is small, the risk-averse voters’ lower tendency to support the populist radical right, combined with men's greater risk acceptance (Figure 1), results in a higher rate of support for the PRRPs among men compared to women. These results are consistent with Hypothesis 1. The Effect of a Risky Electoral Context We now factor in the effect of context to examine whether the electoral behavior of women and men is different in the face of a risky electoral choice. Models 3–5 in Table 1 report the results of probit regression models predicting the vote for PRRPs as a function of these parties’ past electoral and legislative success. Specifically, we report the effect of cross-level interactions between gender and a risky context on the vote. The negative coefficient of gender (male) interacted with past electoral success (see SI Figure C2, p. 26, for a graphic presentation of this interaction) indicates that, as anticipated, women's vote is more affected by a risky electoral context than men's. As per Model 3, in cases where PRRPs entered parliament in previous elections, the predicted probability for female voters to support PRRPs is more than double compared to cases where PRRPs did not make it into parliament in the past. For men, no significant differences in the predictive probabilities to vote for PRRPs were found between risky and non-risky electoral contexts. To corroborate these findings, we investigated whether Green parties, which had also started out as challenger parties and in the 1980s were still relatively unknown, garnered more support from men than from women. Assessing the gender gap in the vote for these parties from the 1980s until 2016, we find that women refrained from voting for Green parties while these were new and therefore a risky choice. However, when these parties gained electoral success and established themselves in European party systems, women joined them at higher numbers than men. These findings, displayed in SI Figure C3 (p. 27), are in line with our assumption that women are more risk-averse than men when it comes to vote choice. What mechanisms account for the gender differences in political behavior in a risky electoral context observed in Models 3–5 in Table 1? Our second and third hypotheses suggest that compared to men, women perceive greater risk in an uncertain context and are less prone to translate extreme ideological positions to political behavior, such as voting for PRRPs. Put differently, risk aversion and ideological extremism both have a differential effect on the vote of men and women, especially in a risky electoral context. Table 2 tests these hypotheses. Model 1 interacts gender with risk aversion, and Model 3 interacts gender with ideological self-placement; thus, the parameters of risk aversion and ideological self-placement are each assigned a gender-specific coefficient. Models 2 and 4 are similar to Models 1 and 3, respectively, but are executed only on those cases in which voting for the radical right is a risky choice—specifically, where the vote share of PRRPs is lower or equal to the median vote share of these parties in the pooled data. Filtering the cases according to this criterion cuts the sample size by more than half, thereby distilling the effect of the political context and yielding a more accurate estimation of the interaction terms. For robustness purposes, we reran our analysis on cases where PRRPs did not enter parliament in t-1—thus splitting our sample elsewhere—and using a different measure for a risky context. The results were similar to the ones presented in Models 2 and 4 (SI Table C3, p. 12). Comparing Models 1 and 3 (all cases) with Models 2 and 4 (risky context), respectively, reveals that the coefficients (for risk aversion/ideological extremism and the respective interaction terms with gender) are larger in Models 2 and 4, with a consequent higher statistical significance. Therefore, to substantively evaluate the effect of risk aversion and ideological self-placement on the vote, and in particular the differential effect in this regard between women and men, we calculated, for both genders, the predicted probability of voting for PRRPs based on Models 2 and 4 across different levels of risk aversion and ideological self-placement. Figures 2 and 3 present the results of this analysis. Figure 2 displays predicted probabilities for women and men to vote for PRRPs as a function of their risk aversion. The black line represents women's and the gray line men's predicted vote (95% confidence intervals in parentheses). The downward trending of the graphs for both men and women indicates that one's tendency to avoid risk decreases the likelihood of one's voting for PRRPs, as could be expected. For men, however, the differences between risk-averse and risk-accepting individuals are not statistically significant. For women, these differences are significant, indicating that, compared to risk-accepting women, risk-averse women tend to refrain more from voting for PRRPs.5 The figure also demonstrates the differences in the effect risk aversion has on women's and men's likelihood to vote for PRRPs. The more we move toward the risk-averse side of the horizontal axis, the larger are the differences between men's and women's likelihood to vote for PRRPs. Put differently, risk-averse women are less likely to vote for PRRPs compared to risk-averse men. This shows that women's electoral behavior is sensitive to risky contexts, whereas men's is not. These findings attest to gender differences in the perception of risk whereby not only are women more risk-averse than men (Figure 1), but they may also tend to perceive realities as riskier than men and are therefore more reactive to a risky context in their vote. The results of the analysis support Hypothesis 2. Figure 3 displays the predicted probabilities of voting for PRRPs in risky electoral contexts across values of left–right self-placement, holding other variables at their respective means. As expected, as we move from left to right along the self-placement continuum, the probability of supporting PRRPs substantially increases: from about 1% for those who place themselves ideologically on the left to about 10% for those located on the extreme right. In all positions on the left–right ideological scale, women are less likely to support PRRPs compared to men. More importantly, the change in probability is of greater magnitude for men than for women, suggesting that, consistent with our expectation, the effect of extreme right ideological position on the vote is substantially larger among men than among women. Right-extremist men are twice as likely to vote for PRRPs than their female counterparts (10% and 5.2%, respectively). In other words, men position themselves on the extreme right more than women (see Figure 1), and their ideological positions translate more strongly to vote choice. We suggest that, in keeping with Hypothesis 3, this is a good indication that women perceive the social risk of voting for PRRPs in risky situations as greater compared to men. To the extent that women are prone to avoid PRRPs, which parties do right-extremist women vote for? SI Table C4 (p. 14) shows that extreme right-wing women tend to vote for conservative parties. In multinomial regression models, we compared respondents’ propensity to vote for PRRPs (reference category) versus other party families. Results of this estimation support the hypothesis that, compared to men, women are less likely to vote for PRRPs even when they are ideologically closest to these parties. This finding also corroborates our contention that, being socially risk-averse, women refrain from voting for PRRPs as their behavior is more reactive to party reputation and societal norms. Robustness Checks We reran our analysis with partly different empirical specifications. By and large, the results hold across almost all variations. The details are described below. Model Specification The analysis in Table 1 was rerun using hierarchical logistic models (SI Table C5, p. 15). This analysis was also repeated using linear probability modeling. Results are similar to those reported for the main analysis. Classification of PRRPs A different classification of populist radical right parties was used in repeated analyses, based on Norris (2005; see SI Appendix B, p. 8, for the list of PRRPs included in each classification; see SI Tables C6 and C7, pp. 16–17, for the analysis). Our results hold. Additional Control Variables Studies have shown that blue-collar workers and small business groups tend to vote for PRRPs (e.g., Ivarsflaten 2005). Accordingly, the analysis was repeated, controlling for occupational class (SI Table C8, p. 18). As PRRPs also advance anti-feminist agendas and culturally conservative attitudes that might drive women away, we also controlled for these parties’ ideological positions on the second dimension. The results are fully consistent with those obtained originally (SI Tables C9 and C10, pp. 20–22). Lastly, women might systematically disagree with PRRPs’ visions of illiberal democracy more than men, which may, in turn, affect the gender gap in the vote for these parties. In the main analysis, we control for trust in politicians, a proxy for the democratic dissatisfaction that is often seen as driving populist support. In the supporting information (Table C11, p. 23), we also control for respondents’ level of agreement with the item “Political parties that wish to overthrow democracy should be banned.” Results are consistent with those reported in the main analysis. Risky Context As part of the main investigation, the sample was split according to country-years in which the vote share of PRRPs is lower or equal to the median vote share, and the analysis was then repeated for this population, as per Models 2 and 4 in Table 2. These models were rerun using a different measure: country-years where PRRPs did not make it into parliament in t-1. The results, displayed in SI Table C3 (p. 12), are similar to and in fact slightly stronger than the results reported in the main analysis, assuaging concerns over arbitrariness in choosing the cut-off point to delimit risky contexts. Isolating Electoral and Social Risk Aversion: The German Case The analysis of the cross-national observational data presented above lends support to the two hypothesized mechanisms behind the gender gap in the vote for PRRPs, namely, electoral risk and social risk. Although the two causal sequences differ in microfoundations, the above cross-sectional analysis cannot provide decisive evidence as to which mechanism is at work. Indeed, these two dynamics are not mutually exclusive: Women may be reluctant to vote for new populist right-wing parties, or for parties that did not make it into parliament in the past, owing to either a behavioral proclivity to avoid electoral risks or their tendency to conform to societal norms, or both. To distill the effect of electoral risk, we leverage the case of Germany, which assists us in two ways. First, the German mixed-member proportional electoral system allows each voter two ballots, therefore enabling us to identify voters who made a socially risky choice by voting for a PRRP on one vote but refrained from doing so on the other. This minimizes the possible effect of a socially driven risk aversion and foregrounds the electoral-risk mechanism. Second, we examine our argument comparing two German parties that present a similar degree of electoral risk: a PRRP (Alternative für Deutschland, AfD) and a mainstream centrist party (Freie Demokratische Partei, FDP). Similar results obtained for both parties will point to an electoral risk-aversion mechanism, which applies to electorally risky parties in general, not only PRRPs. "
17,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA04-2022-JOP.txt," How does conflict affect firms’ investment decisions? Past results are mixed: a third of the studies we reviewed report null or mixed correlations; some suggest that conflict increases investment. We rationalize these results, arguing that armed conflict has divergent effects depending on firms’ exposure to violence. Conflict can deter investment by disrupting production or raising uncertainty. Yet, conflict can encourage investment by hampering government oversight. We argue that each mechanism operates over different geographic extents. We use data from the mining sector to test these claims and report three main results. Firms operating at conflict sites dramatically reduce investments. By contrast, firms operating in territory surrounding conflict, but separated from fighting, actually increase investment. Firms far from violence see a small negative effect. These divergent responses cannot be inferred from aggregate flows: we show that conflict depresses aggregate investment, but this reflects responses among firms far from fighting. When firms and individuals fear that future economic returns will be destroyed or expropriated, they have little incentive to invest. This foundational tenet of economic development motivates a large literature in comparative and international political economy which identifies institutions that reassure potential domestic (e.g., Besley and Persson 2011; North 1981; Stasavage 2002) and foreign investors (e.g., Büthe and Milner 2008; Jensen 2003; Vernon 1971).1 Limiting armed conflict is of primary importance: civil war has been concisely described as “development in reverse” (Collier et al. 2003). By monopolizing violence, states allay fears of predation and realize the “colossal [economic] gains from providing domestic tranquility” (Olson 1993, 567). In this paper, we argue that armed conflict—which often implies the breakdown of institutions—has divergent effects on investment among firms operating within the same country and industry, depending on each firm’s geographic proximity to violence. We propose three channels through which armed conflict affects firms’ investment decisions.2 First, conflict can disrupt or destroy production, discouraging investment. Second, conflict can undermine state capacity, which has theoretically ambiguous effects on investment: firms may enjoy reduced oversight but lament the withdrawal of protection and public services.3 Finally, conflict can increase uncertainty about the government’s standing or policy agenda, leading to divestment. Critically, we argue that these mechanisms apply to different geographic areas surrounding an armed conflict. Threats to production, we claim, are very local, affecting the small proportion of investments located at the sites of conflict. State capacity should be diminished in buffer zones—areas affected by armed conflict where the state’s control over territory is disputed, but fighting is not active. Both claims reflect the scale of modern armed conflicts, which are characterized by relatively small, sporadic battles that affect limited territory (Berman, Felter, and Shapiro 2018). Finally, uncertainty around policy changes or reputational risk impacts all firms operating in a country with conflict. Conflict may not, thus, have a uniform effect on firms’ investment decisions: a firm’s proximity to violence shapes how it responds (see fig. 1 for an illustration). Indeed, conflict may not always deter investment—a point underscored in recent work by Osgood and Simonelli (2019), who show that firms with higher exit costs are less responsive to violence.4 Social scientists have long worked to quantify the impact of instability on investment (for an early contribution, see Bennett and Green [1972]): our systematic review finds 75 published empirical studies of this relationship since 1990. Most papers (64%) report a negative conditional correlation. Yet, almost all of these past studies use aggregate data to estimate the relationship between conflict and investment at the country level. This recovers a weighted average of effects for firms operating near and far from fighting. When these effects push in different directions, the weighted average masks heterogeneous firm responses. We advance the literature by addressing this ecological inference problem and offering empirical tests of our theoretical claims, which predict divergent firm-level responses. We construct global panel data on the investments and projects of mining firms, which enable us to measure where armed conflicts occur relative to firms’ operations. Our outcome data measure how much each firm invests in exploration activities in every country and in every year between 1997 and 2014. Our data enable a research design in which we compare investment among firms near and far from conflict, before and after the violence occurs. We include firm-by-year, firm-by-country, and country-by-year fixed effects in our models to rule out a large set of potential confounds. In addition to providing a unique source of data, mining is an important domain for evaluating the effects of conflict on investment: the extractives sector accounted for over 30% of greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI) in low-income countries in 2011 (UNCTAD 2012, 64) and is featured in foundational work on the property rights and decision-making of foreign investors (e.g., Moran 1974; Vernon 1971). We find that a small number of firms with operations at conflict sites (within 5 kilometers of an armed conflict) reduce their investments dramatically following violence. Yet, firms operating in the territory surrounding conflict but separated from the actual fighting (up to 60 km from an armed conflict) actually increase their investment. This effect is largest for firms with an operation that is 30–40 kilometers from an armed conflict. These firms appear to be a safe distance from the violence and yet they are close enough to benefit from how conflict diminishes states’ oversight capacity. Finally, we find that firms well removed from violence see a small negative effect. As this last group constitutes the largest share of firms, this small effect contributes most to the country-level finding and, thus, masks responses among the firms more proximately affected by violence. With our data aggregated to the country-year level, we show that armed conflict depresses investment. We incorporate auxiliary data to explore several mechanisms. First, using mine-level panel data from projects across Africa, we show that armed conflict disrupts production, but only for mines located at conflict sites (within 5 km of the violence). The likelihood that a mine produces anything falls by 30 percentage points two years after nearby conflict. Second, drawing on country-year data, we show that the elasticity between mineral production and tax revenues from natural resources falls after countries experience armed conflicts involving the state. This is consistent with the claim that conflict undermines the state’s ability to tax mining activity, one dimension of state capacity that may be affected in buffer zones. Finally, at the country-year level, we show that conflict reduces government stability in conflict-affected states. We make three contributions: conducting a formal, “systematic review” of prior empirical work; developing a theoretical framework that relates firms’ investment responses to their geographic exposure to conflict; and providing new evidence on how and why firms respond, both positively and negatively, to armed conflict. Our theory and analyses help decompose aggregate findings and, in so doing, reveal that analyses of aggregate investment flows can miss the investment-promoting effect of conflict among a subset of firms. We help advance debates in comparative and international political economy. Influential work in comparative politics argues that states may not monopolize the use of violence; in fact, their capacity does not always extend far beyond capitals or into borderlands (Boone 2003; Herbst 2000). More recent empirical work maps states’ limited capacity (Lee and Zhang 2017; Pierskalla, Schultz, and Wibbels 2017). We build on this research by describing the behavior of firms operating in gray zones, where the state’s authority is contested. Consistent with case studies from Guidolin and La Ferrara (2007) and Christensen, Nguyen, and Sexton (2019), we find that certain firms can benefit from the state’s incomplete control. Seminal work in international political economy argues that investors shy away from countries that cannot credibly protect their property rights (e.g., Moran 1974; Vernon 1971). More recent contributions expand upon this argument, showing how the characteristics of host governments (e.g., Jensen 2008; Lee 2017), industries (e.g., Burger, Ianchovichina, and Rijkers 2015; Jamison 2019; Wright and Zhu 2018), and individual firms (e.g., Barry 2018; Osgood and Simonelli 2019) affect investment responses to instability and other forms of political risk. We make a complementary contribution, showing that firms’ geographic exposure to violence moderates their response to instability. Finally, the vast majority of papers identified through our systematic review focus on country-level measures of conflict and aggregate investment. We adopt a firm-centered view and introduce a key source of heterogeneity in firms’ investment behavior: conflict exposure. In doing so, we parallel developments elsewhere in international political economy in the study of trade and, more recently, foreign investment (Barry 2016; Zhu and Shi 2019). Systematic Review of Existing Empirical Work Nearly five decades ago scholars began quantitatively studying how political instability shapes investment, using newly available cross-national data (e.g., Bennett and Green 1972). To assess the weight of this evidence, we conduct a formal systematic review.5 The goal is to identify and summarize all research that meets prespecified criteria, rather than focusing on a researcher-selected subset that may, for example, exclude earlier work or research from adjacent disciplines. Using the protocol detailed in appendix H.1, we examined 15,583 books and articles to identify 75 peer-reviewed studies that meet four criteria: (1) published in 1990 or later; (2) published in a peer-reviewed social science or business journal or by a university press; (3) examines the relationship between conflict and foreign investment, with a measure of conflict as an independent variable and investment as a dependent variable; and (4) includes a point estimate (see fig. H.1).6 Table A.1 describes the individual studies. The data used in each study cover multiple years, spanning 1950–2013, with the bulk of the observations coming from the four decades between 1970 and 2010. Sixty-four percent find a negative conditional correlation between instability or conflict and investment (see Table 1).7 Scholars have identified this negative relationship in broad cross-national samples, in industrialized democracies, and in low-income countries. In the paper most immediately relevant to our own, Guidolin and La Ferrara (2007) turn the conventional wisdom on its head: they find that diamond mining companies actually benefited from Angola’s civil war. The sudden end of the conflict in 2002 led to a 4-percentage-point drop in cumulative abnormal returns for companies holding concessions in Angola. “No matter how high the costs to be borne by diamond mining firms in Angola during the conflict,” they write, “the war appears to have generated some counterbalancing ‘benefits’ that in the eye of investors more than outweighed these costs” (Guidolin and La Ferrara 2007, 1978). Many studies fail to consistently find a significant correlation between conflict or instability and investment. Null or mixed findings make up more than one-third of the studies. The papers in this literature differ along several dimensions, relying on different samples, dependent variables, and measures of conflict or instability, and exploiting different sources of variation. This makes it difficult to pinpoint why their findings diverge. We focus on three common features of past studies. First, only half of the studies include unit fixed effects (see Table 1). Without them, estimates may reflect omitted variable bias from characteristics that make countries susceptible to conflict and inhospitable to investment (e.g., autocracy). Few (12) include time fixed effects, which raises the additional possibility that estimates are confounded by investment booms that happen to coincide with changes in the frequency of armed conflict. Second, 40% of the studies rely on a composite measure of political risk, of which violence is only one component (for a critique of these measures, see Henisz [2000, 3]).8 Finally, likely due to data availability, more than 80% of the studies focus on country-level measures of investment and violence. Yet, investment decisions are made at the firm or project level, and the violence these firms confront is increasingly localized—sporadic insurgent attacks rather than large-scale wars (Berman et al. 2018). Theory of Conflict Exposure and Investment Past theoretical work has highlighted that instability and conflict can have very different effects on firms operating in the same country. Kobrin (1978, 114) lays out the firm’s calculus: “The manager should be interested in political instability only to the extent that it is likely to constrain actual or potential operations. One must ask two questions. What is the probability of a given irregular event occurring and, given that event, what is the probability it will affect my firm? … Political risk is not a homogenous phenomenon; vulnerability is clearly industry, firm, and even project specific.” Recent empirical work uncovers firm-level heterogeneity. Osgood and Simonelli (2019), for example, find that US multinational corporations with immobile assets are less responsive to terrorism. Relatedly, Barry (2018, 283) finds that conflict deters new ventures but that established firms weather low-level conflict. Others argue that political connections (Fisman 2001) and diversification (Dai, Eden, and Beamish 2017; Witte et al. 2016) moderate firms’ exposure to instability and conflict. Recognizing this heterogeneity, we develop a framework to predict how investors’ responses to armed conflict vary based on their proximity to violence. First, conflict could disrupt production by making operations unsafe or infeasible. Second, it could undermine state capacity and, thus, hamper oversight or undermine property rights or public services. Third, conflict may increase uncertainty around the government’s domestic or international policy agendas. Finally, firms may fear that their reputations will be damaged from operating in a conflict-affected state. These mechanisms can generate countervailing effects. Production stoppages might discourage investment, but less regulation could be a boon for the private sector. Limited oversight might reduce operating costs, and yet, firms’ reputations could take a hit for working alongside a government embroiled in civil conflict. As the Economist (2000) summarizes, “for brave businessfolk, there are thus rich pickings in grim places. But there are also immense obstacles and risks.” An investor’s response to conflict, thus, depends on which of these mechanisms apply and their relative magnitudes. We argue that these mechanisms apply to different areas around an armed conflict event.9 We delineate three concentric extents: (1) the conflict site, where fighting actually takes place; (2) the buffer zone surrounding the conflict site, where the state’s control may be disputed but fighting is not active; and (3) the country with conflict. Figure 1 illustrates these three extents of exposure for a hypothetical conflict in Sierra Leone. To demarcate the conflict site and buffer zone, we use circular buffers that emanate from where fighting takes place. Firms operating at conflict sites are directly threatened by violence and most likely to see their operations disrupted. Mihalache-O’keef and Vashchilko (2010) offer examples from insurance claims submitted to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a US government agency that provides political risk insurance to US firms. In 1979, government troops and Sandinistas took turns occupying and bombarding American Standard’s facilities in Nicaragua. In 1977, Freeport Mineral’s copper mine in West Papua, Indonesia, was targeted by separatists; the firm paid for military personnel to secure its site. For these firms, violence threatened physical capital or critical infrastructure, discouraging continued investment. Armed civil conflict, almost by definition, implies that the state has lost its monopoly on violence in some part of its territory. Beyond the specific sites of battles, the buffer zones surrounding conflicts are often regarded as ungoverned or no-go areas, where the legitimacy or capacity of the central state is contested. This could benefit firms operating in buffer zones around conflict if it inhibits the state’s capacity to tax firms (formally or informally) or enforce regulations (e.g., environmental or labor standards). If conflict renders buffer zones inaccessible or unsafe for bureaucrats, firms can more easily evade tax and regulatory efforts (Ch et al. 2018). Le Billon (2008, 1) outlines the challenge facing governments attempting to oversee mining firms in buffer zones (see also Guidolin and La Ferrara 2007; van den Boogaard et al. 2018): “Governments often suffer from lack of knowledge about the resources available for exploitation and recent developments in the sector—due, for example, to lapses in surveys, undocumented wartime resource exploitation, death or flight of qualified personnel, and outdated training. As a result, governments fail to maximize revenue collection, especially when negotiating with better informed companies.” In addition to a reduced tax burden, mining firms may also be able to engage in cost-saving measures only possible with limited state oversight: encroaching on land without prior consent or compensation, engaging in unlicensed activity (e.g., starting production on an exploration license), or employing methods that violate environmental or labor standards (Smith and Rosenblum 2011). Recent empirical work generalizes these arguments, finding that internal conflict depresses states’ fiscal capacity (e.g., Chowdhury and Murshed 2016).10 Besley and Persson (2008, 528), for example, find that countries facing internal conflict have a tax-to-GDP ratio that is 7% lower. Moreover, governments may provide special financing, supplemental insurance coverage, or statutory tax relief for firms that continue to operate despite nearby conflicts (Berman 2000). However, diminished state capacity could also harm firms operating in buffer zones and cause them to reduce investment. A capacitated state may secure firms’ property rights by both protecting assets (Besley and Persson 2008; McDougal 2010) and limiting extortion by state or nonstate actors (e.g., protection rackets run by corrupt local officials or rebel groups) (Collier 1999; Keen 1998). Moreover, if firms rely on infrastructure impacted by conflict (e.g., road networks that have been damaged or disrupted by road blocks), this could increase operating costs (Collier 1999; Mills and Fan 2006). Finally, while less of a concern in enclave industries like mining (Banerjee et al. 2014), the state’s provision of public services or utilities may be disrupted, forcing firms to devise costly stopgaps or delay activities while they await permits. These risks could sour investors, inhibiting firms’ access to finance. Most firms mine far from violence. Armed conflict in the borderlands of northern Myanmar, for example, does not directly impact coal mines located hundreds of kilometers away. This reflects an important feature of modern armed conflicts: they are not geographically encompassing campaigns but, rather, “small wars” (Berman et al. 2018). Blattman and Miguel (2010, 39) observe that “civil wars are also often localized and fought with small arms and munitions, so they do not necessarily see the large-scale destruction of capital caused by bombing” (on downward trends in battle deaths, see Lacina, Gleditsch, and Russett [2006]). This is apparent in our data: for firms operating within 20 kilometers of fighting, the average conflict they are exposed to involves only 5.6 deaths on average. Research on political risk argues that firms far from fighting can still be adversely impacted by conflict-induced policy changes. “If instability is to affect significantly foreign investors,” Kobrin (1978, 115) writes, “it is most likely to do so through a change in government policy.” If violence in northern Myanmar, to continue our example, affects the government’s domestic or international standing or generates other policy uncertainty, this could deter investment. In the extreme, would-be investors may worry about regime change or the expropriation of assets (Jensen 2003) provoked by the fiscal demands of conflict.11 Short of government turnover or expropriation, investors may fear changes related to license fees, the terms of joint ventures with the state, currency restrictions or devaluations, or travel restrictions (for a theory of when governments breach contracts with foreign firms, see Wellhausen [2014]). A distinct, country-level mechanism concerns the reputation of firms among shareholders or consumers, who may avoid companies operating in conflict-affected states (Henisz 2017). The Economist observes that “firms doing business in countries with unpleasant governments have been pilloried by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), endangering the most priceless of assets, their good name” (quoted in Bennett 2001, 2). Blanton and Blanton (2007, 145) use Apple’s rapid divestment from Myanmar as an example of companies avoiding countries with poor human rights records, a characteristic correlated with civil conflict. We collect these mechanisms in Table 2. Armed conflict could amplify or deter investment depending on a firm’s proximity to violence and the relative magnitudes of these mechanisms. Relying on aggregate data, existing empirical work has been unable to estimate the effects of these different extents of conflict exposure. We do so in this paper and test the following four hypotheses: H1 (Conflict site) Firms reduce their investment in countries where their operations are located at conflict sites. H2 (Buffer zone) Firms change their investment in countries where their operations are located in a buffer zone around armed conflict, with the direction of change depending on the magnitude of countervailing mechanisms. H3 (Country with conflict) Firms reduce their investment in conflict-affected countries where their operations are distant from armed conflict. H4 (Aggregate effect) As most firms’ operations are distant from armed conflict, the effect of armed conflict on aggregate investment in a country is negative. Data We use fine-grained data from the mining sector to test these theoretical predictions using a research design that overcomes inferential challenges in past work. Mining is an important sector, particularly in developing, conflict-prone countries. Forty percent of greenfield FDI in low- and lower-middle-income countries between 2003 and 2015 went into extractives projects (Financial Times2019). The next largest sectors are real estate, communications, and financial services. Over 50 countries depended on natural resources for more than 20% of exports or 10% of GDP between 1995 and 2015 (Davy and Tang-Lee 2018, 2). This scale has attracted academic attention. Influential work on the political economy of foreign investment focuses on the mining sector (e.g., Moran 1974; Vernon 1971), and conflict has been an important outcome for scholars studying the consequences of extractive industries (e.g., Berman et al. 2017; Christensen 2019). Without comparable firm-country-year investment data from other sectors, we cannot assess whether our estimates generalize to other industries. Past work suggests that mining investments may be less vulnerable to violence. First, mining is tied to fixed geologic features and, thus, not easily relocated. In response to conflict, mining firms—unlike manufacturers—cannot easily relocate to protect their assets.12 Second, recognizing that exit is not possible, mining firms may also spend more on private security and utilities to reduce their vulnerability to conflict. The World Bank, for example, reports that “many mining companies [in sub-Saharan Africa] are still opting to supply their own electricity with diesel generators rather than buy power from the grid” (World Bank 2015). The immovability of mining investments and firms’ endogenous expenditure on private precautions likely dampen the effect of conflict on investments relative to other sectors. However, using data from fDi Markets (Financial Times2019), we find no evidence that armed conflict has differential effects on aggregate investment in the natural resource sectors (fig. E.1) or, specifically, metals and minerals (table E.1) relative to other sectors (app. E describes these analyses). Investment data Our outcome is mining firms’ exploration investment (deflated to real USD in 1997), based on data from SNL Metals and Mining. SNL Metals and Mining obtains data through a survey of companies and, in the event of nonresponse or refusal, the budgets are compiled by SNL and sent to the firms for confirmation or adjustment. The data are at the firm-country-year level: we observe how much the same firm invests in different countries in the same year. The data provide global coverage from 1997 to 2014 for major minerals, including base metals (e.g., copper, tin), diamonds, gold, iron, platinum group metals, rare earths, silver, uranium, and others.13 This investment is not exclusively FDI, as it includes investments by domestically owned firms; nonetheless, figure B.1 shows that aggregate exploration investment and net FDI inflows are positively correlated. To understand the expenses that fall under exploration investment, we randomly sampled 80 firm-year observations where conflict occurred within 30 kilometers of a firm’s mining project. All of the available annual reports (62) detail exploration investment, listing costs related to drilling, surveying, assaying, scoping, and feasibility studies. We checked whether firms include security-related costs under exploration, and only 17 mention security concerns: seven do not list any security expenditure; nine explicitly exclude security spending from exploration spending, including it instead under general, administrative, or other costs; and only one (Torex Gold Resources Inc. in 2014) lists security spending under exploration. Companies exposed to conflict may spend on security, but this is not captured by our outcome variable. Our data include 4,331 firms investing in 177 countries (the decision not to invest is also an observation in our data). This is not a balanced panel: a firm does not enter our data set until it invests in at least one country. The data exclude investments under US$100,000; nonetheless, SNL estimates that this covers 95% of commercially oriented nonferrous exploration expenditure.14Table B.1 summarizes the regions and commodities that constitute our data. Table B.2 shows that total annual investment over our study period closely tracks global prices for metals. While developing a mine is a long-term investment, exploration activity responds rapidly to changes in prices and market sentiment. This is because most exploration is undertaken by small, “junior” firms that rely on fickle equity financing (Humphreys 2015, 129). The typical mining exploration firm invests in a small number of countries: the average firm invests for roughly six years in just over two countries. This average level of diversification is pulled up by outliers: a very small number of firms invest globally, in up to 60 countries. The modal firm concentrates its investments in a single country, and, even when firms do invest in multiple countries, they tend to concentrate spending in a single country. We show this in figure B.3(a) by plotting the effective number of countries in which firms invest.15 This low level of diversification highlights that the largest mining companies (e.g., BHP or Rio Tinto) do not represent the vast majority of firms. Indeed, globally there are only 100–150 “major” mining firms (Humphreys 2015, 10), whereas our sample includes exploration investment by 4,331 firms. Most companies engaged in mining exploration are “junior” mining firms—small companies that often specialize in exploration and mine development; 91% of mining projects in our data are owned exclusively by these junior firms. Descriptions of these junior firms suggest that they prefer weakly regulated environments. They “[take] ‘short cuts’ by using bribes and other corrupt inducements to attain their objectives” and often fail to meet environmental or social standards (Marshall 2001, 17). Junior companies do not boast the large corporate social responsibility programs of their major counterparts. Rather, they often fail to engage their host communities, manage their environmental impacts, or encourage sustainable development (Dougherty 2013). This tendency to skirt regulations and industry standards relates to three common features of these companies: (1) their financiers typically do not require compliance with environmental and social standards; (2) these little-known firms do not worry about scandals damaging their reputations; and (3) these companies (sometimes described as “cowboys”) lack strong corporate governance and, instead, reward employees who advance short-term objectives using unethical or corrupt methods (Dougherty 2013; Marshall 2001). Armed conflict data To code our independent variable, we use the Uppsala Conflict Data Program’s Georeferenced Event Dataset (UCDP GED).16 A conflict event is “an incident where armed force was used by an organized actor against another organized actor, or against civilians, resulting in at least one direct death at a specific location and a specific date” (Croicu and Sundberg 2017, 2). When conducting analyses at the firm-country-year level, we only retain those conflicts that can be geocoded to an exact location or nearby place name (see fig. B.5 for a mapping of all such events; table B.2 summarizes the severity of conflict across continent and subregion).17 We further restrict attention to events between 1997 and 2014, the years for which we have exploration investment data. We also separately examine three different types of conflict classified in the UCDP data: (1) state-based events: an organized actor uses armed force against another organized actor, of which at least one is the central government; (2) one-sided events: the government uses armed force against civilians; and (3) nonstate events: an organized actor uses armed force against another organized actor, neither of which is the government. Measuring exposure to armed conflict SNL provides data on the locations of commercial (nonfuel) mining projects (see fig. B.4). We know the owners of each project (and their respective shares) and use this information to link projects to the firms making exploration investments.18 By mapping both mining projects and armed conflicts, we can determine whether a conflict occurred within a certain distance of a project (partially) owned by a specific firm. Rather than choosing a single distance cutoff, we use multiple bandwidths—buffers around mining projects of varying radii (see fig. C.1). For every firm-country-year, we count the number of conflicts that occur within a given bandwidth across all of their projects. A firm can only be directly exposed to conflict if it already operates a project in the country where violence takes place. The Euclidean distance between conflicts and mining projects has attractive features: it is easy to understand, can be computed globally and does not vary over time, does not require auxiliary data, and follows past work from Dai, Eden, and Beamish (2013, 2017). Yet, mining projects operating in the buffer zones around armed conflict are often in rural and rugged parts of low- and middle-income countries—settings with limited infrastructure, where travel is difficult. Using a global data set of roads, we estimate how long you would have to travel to get from the conflict site to a mining operation that falls in the first, 5–20 kilometer buffer zone (see app. C.1). While the average Euclidean distance is 13.7 kilometers, the average path distance along any known road is three times larger (39.3 km). Yet, even this shortest path distance is an understatement, as it does not account for road quality. (Moreover, for 4% of cases, the roads closest to the conflict do not even connect to the roads closest to the mine.) Using weights that reflect the estimated travel speeds along different roads, we estimate that the average weighted distance from conflict sites to mines is over 71. That is, these sites are separated by a “travel distance” equivalent to getting on a clear freeway and driving just over 71 kilometers, which is five times the average crow-flies distance. Travel costs dampen mines’ exposure to nearby conflicts. Exposure could, of course, be measured in other ways given additional data (e.g., the destruction of transport infrastructure). Christensen (2019) finds that relatively few commercial mines in Africa have been the sites of armed conflicts. Those results are consistent with what we find globally: we identify just 94 firm-country-years where a conflict occurred within 10 kilometers of a mining project in the same or previous year, but 914 firm-country-years where conflict occurred within 60 kilometers of a mining project in the same or previous year (see table B.3). These 914 firm-country-year observations represent US$3.31 billion of exploration investment. Research Design We evaluate the effects of conflict exposure on firms’ investments in conflict-affected countries. We estimate three causal effects that correspond to different extents of exposure: (1) the effect for firms with operations at a conflict site (τsite); (2) the effect for firms with operations in the buffer zone (τbuffer); and (3) the effect for firms with operations within a conflict-affected country, but outside the buffer zone (τcountry). If a firm has a project at a conflict site, that project is also within a buffer zone and in a conflict-affected country. Our model allows us to decompose the total effects that we estimate and, thus, separate the potentially cross-cutting effects of operating near a conflict site that is nested in a larger buffer zone. Specifically, we assume: where ζ parameterizes the effect attributable to operating at a conflict site; η, to operating in buffer zones; and θ to operating in a conflict-affected country. With three equations and three unknowns (ζ, η, θ), we use our estimates to recover these parameters (e.g., 𝜁 ˆ = 𝜏 ˆ site − 𝜏 ˆ buffer ζ ^ = τ ^ site − τ ^ buffer ).19 We also estimate the effect of armed conflict on aggregate investment. This both helps to relate our setting to past studies of aggregate investment and is a relevant quantity for those interested in predicting total cross-border flows. This effect ( 𝜏 ⎯ ⎯ τ ¯ ) is a weighted sum of τsite, τbuffer, and τcountry, with weights equal to the number of firms within each extent of exposure in a country-year: This equation highlights the danger associated with inferring firms’ behavior from changes in aggregate investment. If τsite is negative but τbuffer is positive, the aggregate effect could appear to be zero. Yet, the inference that firms do not respond to conflict in their investments would be exactly wrong in that case: they respond, just in opposing directions. Conflict may create winners and losers among mining firms who are exposed to violence at different levels. However, this heterogeneity cannot be uncovered in the aggregate data. In our data, we observe how much a firm separately invests in each country annually (i.e., an observation is the firm-country-year). To estimate the causal effects of different extents of conflict exposure, we employ a generalized difference-in-differences design, leveraging the differential change in investment among exposed firms (technically, firm-countries) relative to the change among unexposed firms. This design invokes the standard parallel trends assumption—namely, that exposed and unexposed firms would have the same trends in investment absent any exposure to conflict.20 We fit a linear two-way fixed effects model with firm-country and firm-year fixed effects. Firm-country fixed effects absorb time-invariant features that explain why firms’ investment levels differ across countries (e.g., political connections in a specific state). Firm-year fixed effects address time-varying, firm-specific factors (e.g., changes in management) that could affect investment across the countries in a firm’s portfolio. This also rules out confounding from time-varying global shocks. We estimate: where 𝑖∈{1,2,…,4,331} i ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , 4,331 } indexes firms, 𝑐∈{1,2,…,177} c ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , 177 } indexes countries; and 𝑡∈{1,2,…,18} t ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , 18 } , year. The term yict is exploration investment (logged); Cct is an indicator for whether an armed conflict occurred in country c in year t or in the previous year 𝑡−1 t − 1 ; 𝐷 𝑘 𝑖𝑐𝑡 D i c t k , our measure of conflict exposure, is an indicator for whether a conflict occurred in bandwidth k for any of firm i’s projects in country c and year t or 𝑡−1 t − 1 . This coding captures changes in firms’ investment that manifest in the year of and after conflict, recognizing that instantaneous adjustment may not be possible. The term νict is a firm-country-year-specific error term. We cluster our standard errors at the firm-year level. Our second specification omits Cct and includes country-year fixed effects, which account for any country-specific, time-varying factors affecting conflict and investment (e.g., regime change): This represents a generalized triple-difference design. Our results are consistent using different sets of fixed effects. We present results from equations (2) and (3) below and include results from a simpler model with firm-country and year fixed effects in table D.2. For the analysis of aggregate investment, we rely on a two-way fixed effects design with country and year fixed effects, comparing changes in investment between countries that are differentially affected by armed conflict. We estimate the following panel model: where Yct is aggregate investment (logged), Ac represents the country fixed effects, and Δt represents the year fixed effects. We cluster our standard errors on country. Results We find that firms operating at conflict sites reduce investment in response to conflict; that firms operating in territory surrounding conflict, but separated from fighting, decrease investment; and that firms far from violence see a small negative effect. We show that the aggregate result of these effects is a negative relationship between investment in a country and conflict. We explore mechanisms underlying these effects and show that conflict disrupts production near mining operations, undermines state capacity, and creates policy uncertainty or reputational risk. Effect on investment at the firm-country level Across specifications and samples in Table 3, we consistently find three main results. First, firms dramatically reduce their exploration investment in countries where their operations are located at conflict sites (within 5 km of an armed conflict). Second, firms actually increase their investment in countries where their operations fall between 5 and 60 kilometers of armed conflict. Finally, firms modestly reduce their investment in conflict-affected countries where their operations reside far from the fighting (beyond 60 km). In the first two models of Table 3 we report estimates from equation (2). Model 1 includes a larger set of bandwidths, which code whether a firm has operations in a country within 0–5, 5–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, or 50–60 kilometers of an armed conflict; model 2 collapses several of these bandwidths, coding just whether a firm has operations within 0–5 or 5–60 kilometers of an armed conflict. As these models do not include country-year fixed effects, we can also estimate the response of firms in conflict-affected countries but operating beyond 60 kilometers from fighting. In models 3 and 4 we include country-year fixed effects per equation (3), which absorb the effect of operating further than 60 kilometers from an armed conflict. We find that firms cut their investment in countries where their operations abut the site of an armed conflict (i.e., fall within 0–5 km). After excluding firm-country pairs with no investment over our study period, average exploration investment (logged) is 5.9 ( SD=5 SD = 5 ). In model 1, the estimated effect of having operations within 0–5 kilometers of conflict is roughly 40% of this mean (or half of a standard deviation). This coefficient remains stable when we include the additional country-year fixed effects in model 3. While large, these estimates are imprecise given the small number of firms within this extent of conflict exposure (see table B.3). By contrast, we find that firms increase their investment in countries where their projects fall in the buffer zone surrounding armed conflict. We estimate a positive and significant investment response for firms in countries where their operations fall 5–60 kilometers from fighting. Our estimates initially increase in magnitude as we move further from the conflict, peaking at 30–40 kilometers. This pattern is apparent in figure 2, which plots the coefficients from models 3 and 4. Our estimate from model 4 implies that firms increase their investment by over 25% of the mean in countries where their operations fall 5–60 kilometers from armed conflict.21 Finally, firms modestly reduce investment where they operate further from violence (i.e., beyond 60 km). For any single firm-country, this negative effect is small. Yet, the vast majority of firms exposed to conflict only see fighting from afar. Per equation (1), this small negative effect weighs heavily when estimating the effect of conflict on aggregate country-level investment. We bolster the identifying parallel-trends assumption by showing that there is no evidence that investment trends diverge prior to conflict. Figure D.4 plots the coefficients on the leads and lags of the indicator for having operations within a buffer zone, and we see no significant differential change in investment prior to conflict. We parameterized the effect of operating at a conflict site as ζ, of operating in a buffer zone as η, and being in a country with conflict as θ. Using model 2, we present estimates for these three parameters in Table 4.22 First, operating at the site of battles dramatically reduces investment ( 𝜁 ˆ =−4.06 ζ ^ = −4.06 ). Second, operating in a buffer zone encourages investment by mining firms ( 𝜂 ˆ =1.63 η ^ = 1.63 ). Finally, operating in a country with conflict deters investment, though the effect is minimal if a firm is far from the fighting ( 𝜃 ˆ =−0.002 θ ^ = −0.002 ). The effects are all significantly different from zero at the 𝛼=0.05 α = 0.05 level. The difference in effects between the conflict site and buffer zone and between the conflict site and conflict-affected country are each significant at the 𝛼=0.01 α = 0.01 level. Table 4 also relates our findings to our first three hypotheses: we find a large negative response in countries where firms operate at conflict sites; a smaller, but still substantial, positive response where firms operate in buffer zones; and a small negative effect in countries where firms’ operations are well removed from the fighting. While there could still be offsetting considerations within buffer zones—firms may both enjoy weakened oversight and lament weakened property rights—the investment-encouraging mechanisms appear to dominate. Two characteristics of the mining sector may mitigate the negative effects: firms cannot relocate their assets in response to conflict, as mines are tied to geological features; and, as a consequence, firms may spend more on security and other interrupted public services, mitigating harms that might make other firms halt investment. We might worry that firms reallocate from conflictual to more peaceful environments and that these responses amplify our estimates. Our context helps mitigate such concerns. Exploration portfolios cannot be quickly adjusted. Adding properties to an exploration portfolio, particularly from a new country, typically takes years and requires several lengthy steps: (1) local incorporation, which may take one to three months; (2) exploration license application writing and review, at least three months; (3) access approval from surface rights holders and indigenous consultations, at least two months; (4) water permitting, at least a month; and (5) an environmental impact study, at least three months. Our estimates reflect firms’ investment response in the year of or immediately following conflict; reallocation over such a short time scale would be exceptional. We use subgroup analysis to empirically assess the plausibility of such reallocation. We expect firms invested in multiple countries to be better able to reallocate exploration resources in response to conflict.23 We drop firm-years in our sample that were invested in multiple countries based on a two-year running lag and reestimate equation (3) in model 5. Our inferences are unchanged (see fig. D.2). Even if a firm is working in a single country, perhaps it can reallocate across multiple projects. No firm in our data has projects affected by conflict at the site of violence and in buffer zones. Similarly, no firm has operations in buffer zones and far from violence in a conflict-affected country. In model 6, we restrict the sample to those firms with a single project and reestimate equation (3). Our inferences are again unchanged (see fig. D.3). Specialized capital and labor employed by mines at conflict sites might flee violence, leading to increased supply in the surrounding area. Firms in the buffer zone (or beyond) might increase investment to take advantage of lower resulting input prices. Our data allow us to rule out this concern. First, conflict rarely occurs at mining sites, making displacement unlikely (table B.3). When we observe a firm operating within a buffer zone around conflict, there is often no mining operation at the conflict site from which capital or labor might have fled. Nevertheless, in model 7, we drop country-years where any mining project is at a conflict site and continue to find that firms increase investment in countries where they operate within buffer zones surrounding conflict. A final related concern is that firms reallocate their exploration investment over time. Specifically, firms operating projects in buffer zones may ramp up their investments in an effort to complete exploration before nearby conflicts escalate or creep closer. Such behavior is inconsistent with the business strategy literature, which argues that firms typically adopt a “wait and see” approach and avoid committing major resources when facing emerging risks (Courtney, Kirkland, and Viguerie 1997, 74). Moreover, we assess this empirically by looking at whether heightened investment in buffer zones immediately after conflict is then followed by reduced investment—the pattern consistent with shifting the timing of investment without changing the overall level. Figure D.4 and table D.4 demonstrate that, in fact, the positive effects of exposure to conflict in the buffer zone persist for several years, ruling out such temporal displacement. Effect on investment at country level Our country-level results, which provide a test of hypothesis 4, are consistent with a majority of existing literature: the incidence of fatal armed conflict reduces exploration investment. Table 5 reports consistent estimates from equation (4) using different samples and measures of conflict. Model 1 includes our full sample—177 countries over 18 years—and finds that the incidence of at least one fatal armed conflict in the current or previous year reduces aggregate investment by 0.77 log points. This is just over one-quarter of the average within-country standard deviation (2.78) and roughly 8% of the mean ( 𝑦 𝑐𝑡 ⎯ ⎯ ⎯ ⎯ =9.98 y c t ¯ = 9.98 ). Model 2 drops countries with no investment, and our estimates are of similar magnitudes. We also examine the extensive margin: conflict reduces the number of firms operating in the country with conflict (see table E.1). These country-level results are consistent with the estimates from our model based on the firm-level analyses above. The vast majority of firms investing (or considering investing) in a country operate outside of conflict sites and buffer zones. When we aggregate the effects of conflict to the country level, the largest component of that sum is the negative effect of these firms with minimal conflict exposure. The parameters η and ζ can be sizable, but if they only apply to a relatively small proportion of firms, they will be washed out when we aggregate the data. Finally, we investigate how effects vary by the type and intensity of violence. Model 3 shows, intuitively, that settings with multiple conflicts see a larger reduction in exploration investment; however, both coefficients are negative, and the magnitudes are not significantly different. Models 4–7 look at whether different types of fatal armed conflict—state-based, one-sided, or nonstate—have differential effects on exploration investment. Focusing attention on model 7, we find that one-sided and nonstate conflicts have larger, negative effects.24 In appendix F.1, we report analyses that separate “major” or multinational mining firms—firms that, by virtue of their size and visibility, may be especially concerned about their reputations. We do not find a significantly different response among these subsets of firms (see table F.3).25 This analysis does not, of course, rule out reputational effects—these could affect all firms, or large firms may have other compensating features. Our empirical strategy assumes parallel trends in investment (logged) among countries that are and are not affected by fatal armed conflict. While untestable, we bolster this assumption by showing that investment does not change in anticipation of conflict. Figure F.1 plots the coefficients on the leads and lags of the indicator for a fatal armed conflict (see also table F.2). We see no differential change in investment prior to conflict (i.e., the coefficients on the leads are close to zero), suggesting that the countries that will be attacked are not seeing a spike or falloff in investment in the years before conflict breaks out. The figure also reveals that the negative effects on investment materialize in the first and second years after conflict. The effect on investment is not immediate, suggesting that the allocation of exploration investment may not be updated in real time but adjusted annually (e.g., at the start of the fiscal year). Mechanisms We incorporate auxiliary data to explore the mechanisms outlined in our theory of conflict exposure and investment: that conflict disrupts production at proximate mining operations, undermines state capacity, and creates policy uncertainty or reputational risk. We regard these as secondary, and more speculative, analyses given data and design limitations we note below. Disrupted production Mihalache-O’keef and Vashchilko (2010) recount stories of operations being seized or suspended during conflicts. Local violence threatens staff, severs supply chains, and can destroy critical infrastructure. Ksoll, Macchiavello, and Morjaria (2016, 3) find, for example, that flower exporters in regions affected by Kenya’s postelection violence saw their exports fall by 38%. At the height of the violence, half of their employees were not showing up for work. Research in Sierra Leone (Collier and Duponchel 2013) and Colombia (Camacho and Rodriguez 2013) echo these findings, showing lower production and more business closures in high-conflict areas. We assess this mechanism using the subset of mining projects in Africa, for which we have annual production data (e.g., how many tons of lead or ounces of silver a mine pulled out of the ground). A single mine can produce multiple minerals, so our unit of analysis is the project-mineral-year. We look at the change in production at projects near the site of a recent conflict (within 5 km) versus further afield. Employing a specification similar to equation (3), but with project, year, and mineral fixed effects, we find changes on the extensive and intensive margins for mines at conflict sites: the probability of any production declines by 20 percentage points; the quantity produced (logged) falls by about 20% of the mean (see table G.1). The latter, while sizable, is not significant.26 For projects in a buffer zone but outside of a conflict site (5–60 km from a recent conflict), we find small and insignificant negative effects on the likelihood and intensity of production. The effect of being within 5–60 kilometers of a conflict is an order of magnitude smaller than being next to the fighting (model 2). While these differences are large in magnitude, our estimates are imprecise, and we cannot rule out the null hypothesis of no difference between projects located at conflict sites or further afield. This pattern is consistent with our earlier findings on investment: operating at a conflict site can hamper production and, as a consequence, discourage investment. Yet, these dampening effects are not apparent in the broader buffer zone that surrounds these conflict sites. State capacity Conflict could be a boon for companies if it reduces costly oversight. We assess whether conflict reduces the tax revenues derived from natural resource production. We emphasize that this is not the only aspect of state capacity that may affect firms’ decisions in buffer zones around conflict. It is, however, one dimension that we can measure. We estimate the elasticity between natural resource production and resource tax revenues, and whether this elasticity is reduced (i.e., less tax revenue is derived from production) in countries experiencing armed conflict. We lack firm-level data on tax payments and rely on a country-level measure of resource tax revenues from the International Centre for Tax and Development (ICTD).27 We also compile data from the World Mineral Statistics on annual production for roughly 100 minerals for nearly every country.28 To compute the value of natural resource production, we merge this production data with world commodity prices tracked by the World Bank, US Geological Survey, and US Energy Information Administration. Thus, for every year, we can calculate the dollar value of resources produced (our independent variable) and the amount of resource tax revenue collected (our dependent variable). We log both measures to estimate an elasticity and interact our measure of resource production with a country-level indicator for armed conflict. We focus on the change in this elasticity, as the direct effect of conflict on tax revenues conflates conflict-induced changes in both production and fiscal capacity. Our goal here is to better isolate the latter. As is apparent in figure G.2 (see also table G.2), the production elasticity of resource tax revenues is lower in countries affected by one-sided or state-based conflicts in the current or previous year (models 1 and 3). For a given amount of mineral production, governments recently affected by these types of conflicts collect less in taxes, a finding that is consistent with conflict diminishing fiscal capacity.29 We find no significant effect of nonstate conflicts, which do not involve the government. These results suggest that conflict involving the state may undermine fiscal capacity. While we cannot specify where state fiscal capacity erodes, our findings align with case studies of mining companies profiting from operations in ungoverned areas (e.g., Reno 1999). They could also help explain why we see greater exploration investment among companies operating projects in buffer zones that surround recent fatal armed conflicts: the companies in these gray zones suffer minor production disruptions while benefiting from less oversight. Policy change We look at whether conflict raises concerns about changes in policy. Concretely, we estimate equation (4) using two different outcomes. First, as a manipulation check, we look at whether the incidence of UCDP armed conflicts shifts the “Internal Conflict Index” compiled by the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG)—a data set used by firms that contains measures of multiple components of political risk.30 We find that the armed conflicts we use in our analyses raise concerns that political violence will impact the country’s governance (see table G.3). In the year of or immediately following a fatal armed conflict, ICRG’s Internal Conflict Index falls a half point on a 12-point scale (50% of the average within-country standard deviation for this index). While the UCDP data include small skirmishes and battles, these events shape country-level assessments of internal violence and its impacts on governance. Second, we consider the effect of fatal armed conflict on ICRG’s Government Stability Index, which provides an “assessment both of the government’s ability to carry out its declared program(s), and its ability to stay in office” (PRS Group 2012, 3).31 This measure operationalizes two concerns about investors’ aversion to policy change: investors worry both about whether the current government will survive in office and, if so, whether it will be forced to change course. We find that the incidence of fatal armed conflict decreases assessments of government stability (model 4 of table G.3): a reduction of 0.2 is roughly 15% of the average within-country standard deviation for the Government Stability Index. This finding is robust to multiple ways of measuring conflict (model 5). The effect is larger for nonstate and one-sided conflicts (model 6). We also look at whether conflict deters entry by new companies. As new entrants are unlikely to invest at conflict sites and will not be subject to taxation for several years, the estimated effect among these firms helps us isolate the aggregate country-level effect, which we attribute to increased uncertainty around policy changes or reputational risk.32 We estimate equation (4) but limit our dependent variable to exploration investment in country c in year t to firms that had not previously invested in country c. Our estimates in table G.4 are comparable in magnitude to those reported for the full sample. Conflict does deter investment by potential new entrants to a country. Discussion Earlier empirical work largely supports the oft-repeated claim that conflict is bad for business. This idea underlies policy efforts to prevent and end armed conflict that assume private sector support. A 2016 report from the World Economic Forum, for example, argues that “international and local businesses have a critical role to play in finding ways to minimize fragility and build resilience in violence-affected societies. A key reason, among others, is because fragility—including conflict and crime—is bad for business. It generates direct and indirect opportunity costs all along the value chain” (World Economic Forum 2016, 6). Yet, past research supporting this claim relies overwhelmingly on cross-national analysis, which masks differential effects of conflict on firms operating (or considering operating) in a country. Theoretically, we argue that conflict may deter investment by disrupting production or raising policy uncertainty but that it may encourage investment where it hampers oversight. Moreover, whether these mechanisms apply to a firm depends on its geographic exposure to violence. Using firm-level panel data on mining exploration investment, we show that effects depend on the conflict exposure of firms. We show that mining firms pull back investments at the sites of violence, and the disruption of mineral production may explain why. However, in buffer zone surrounding the fighting—where neither the state nor its armed challengers fully control territory—firms seem to double down on exploration investment. In these areas of imperfect control, the state may be unable to oversee the sector, thereby lowering costs in the short term. We find that effective mineral tax rates decline during conflict. Finally, we show that armed conflicts raise concerns that political violence will impact governance and undermine government stability. This suggests that conflict could deter investment by raising the likelihood of policy change or government turnover. These results demonstrate that conflict is not uniformly bad for business. Indeed, some firms may benefit from how conflict weakens state capacity. Where firms can privately secure their property and do not depend on public services, they may associate improved state capacity with costly regulation or taxation. Different sectors and firms can, thus, vary in their propensity to invest in weak and fragile states. These findings expand upon past case studies (e.g., Fisman 2001), which find that conflict and instability benefit (or only harm) certain companies. The results also parallel efforts to understand when states selectively tolerate or even encourage instability in ungoverned spaces (Christensen et al. 2019). Our findings suggest new directions for research into how heterogeneous exposure to conflict—and the ungoverned gray zones created by conflict—affect conflict termination, postwar economic growth, and the distributional consequences of war. We focus on the effects of armed civil conflict, which is only one factor included in commonly used measures of political risk. As Snider (2005) points out, the measurement of political risk is atheoretical: the ICRG, for example, weights armed conflict heavily but does not articulate why internal conflict receives twice the weight of democratic accountability. We note at least three ways that political risks differ: (1) specificity (do they apply to all or a subset of firms), (2) severity (what is the scale of potential losses), and (3) mitigation (can firms mitigate the risk through private precautions). As we describe earlier, modern armed conflicts tend to be localized, and individual conflict events near mining projects involve relatively few fatalities. Moreover, firms can employ private security to protect their operations. By contrast, nationalization of an industry affects all firms in a sector, implies the loss of immobile assets, and would be difficult for any individual firm to mitigate. We, thus, think of the latter risk as being less specific, more severe, and harder to mitigate than localized armed conflicts. Future research could provide a richer framework for differentiating political risks as well as empirical assessments of how these different risks affect investment behavior."
18,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA05-2022-JOP.txt," Increases in racial minority populations are profoundly reshaping the composition of the American electorate, and multiracial identifiers are one of the fastest growing groups. Yet little is known about the political ideology and policy preferences of Americans who identify with more than one race. We address this gap here by examining the political views of the two biggest US multiracial groups—White-Asians and White-Blacks. We also advance prior work by assessing the role that linked fate, racial group closeness, and race salience play in explaining multiracials’ political attitudes. Leveraging the largest national political survey of multiracial adults to date, we find that White-Asian and White-Black multiracials are on the whole more progressive than Whites, expressing levels of linked fate and social and racial attitudes that are comparable to those of their minority race. We argue that the growth in these multiracial populations seems most likely to benefit the Democratic Party. Projected to triple over the next four decades (Pew 2015), the multiracial population is poised to shape the electoral balance of power in the United States. Yet little is known about the political ideology, partisanship, and attitudes associated with multiracial identities. Here we fill these gaps in the literature by leveraging the most comprehensive national political survey of multiracial adults to date. Our study enables us to make better inferences about the political dynamics of identifying with plural racial categories and contributes to research on multiracialism in key ways. First, in contrast to earlier studies that focused on racial issues (Masuoka 2008), we assess how multiracial Americans navigate their dual identities to form party identification, political ideology, and racial and nonracial policy stances. Whereas research has centered around the behavior of White-Black multiracials (e.g., Davenport 2016; Rockquemore and Brunsma 2008), we expand beyond this population and also examine White-Asians.1 By assessing these two groups—which together account for half of all US multiracials—we evaluate whether the patterns found among White-Blacks translate to White-Asians. Finally, we assess the role of linked fate, racial group closeness, and race salience in explaining multiracials’ political attitudes—measures that have heretofore been unexamined. Theoretical Expectations Historically, hypodescent (the “one-drop rule”) assigned many people of White-Asian and White-Black backgrounds to their minority race and was stringently applied to mixed-race Blacks in particular. The contemporary decision to label oneself with multiple races therefore signals inclusivity, transcends boundaries, and is associated with greater flexibility and less essentialist views (Pauker et al. 2018). We thus hypothesize that multiracial identification is tied to a distinctly liberal political ideology that is reflected in greater support for expansion of cultural freedoms, such as endorsement of women’s reproductive rights and gay rights. Yet multiracials also have a special social and psychological connection to their minority race that is rooted in a mutual history of state-sanctioned discrimination. As a group, Black Americans share the historical experience of slavery and segregation, while Asian Americans have a communal past of being barred from naturalization, and some Asian ethnic groups were subjected to additional formal exclusion (such as via the Chinese Exclusion Act and Japanese American internment during World War II). These collective experiences and the continued marginalization that Blacks and Asians face influence their political behavior today, such that both groups are more progressive and more likely to support an activist government than Whites (Dawson 1994; Kuo, Malhotra, and Mo 2017; Pew 2012). Although hypodescent no longer legally codifies race, White-Asian and White-Black multiracials often perceive themselves as belonging to an oppressed minority group (Davenport 2018). As a result, we posit that when it comes to support for government social programs and issues that directly relate to communities of color, multiracials draw upon their minority group attachments and express views akin to their minority race. The strength of this minority group attachment should depend on multiracials’ component backgrounds, however. Relative to Blacks, Asians have on average faced less residential segregation, are perceived to be higher in status, are more likely to intermarry with Whites, and are more socially mobile (Lee and Bean 2010). Black Americans politically draw upon racial group norms, internalized beliefs about group solidarity, and the social standing of Blacks as a group, and are staunch Democrats (White and Laird 2020). The disparate legacy of hypodescent is such that White-Blacks share Black Americans’ particular history of subjugation in a way that White-Asians do not share that of Asian Americans (Davis 2001), and today, hypodescent more strongly governs perceptions of White-Blacks as minorities than White-Asians (Ho et al. 2011). As a result, we anticipate that on average, multiracial White-Blacks have a stronger sense of minority group consciousness and identity (than White-Asians), which in turn motivates their political attitudes to a greater degree. Categorizing Race and Analyzing Multiracial Respondents Race is constructed, contextual, and can be delineated in different ways (Rockquemore and Brunsma 2008). Here we use the measure employed on all US federal forms, including the census: self-classification. We categorize people who identify as both White and Asian, or White and Black, as “multiracial” and those who identify with a single race as “monoracial.” Our survey was conducted in February and March 2015 and sampled 720 White-Black and 479 White-Asian respondents from YouGov’s Internet panel. We compare multiracials’ attitudes to those of their constituent monoracial groups, sampling 800 White, 500 Black, and 488 Asian respondents.2 Samples were nationally representative by gender, age, and education. Our dependent variables of interest are party affiliation, ideology, and attitudes on cultural issues (same-sex marriage and abortion), social welfare (the Affordable Care Act and government provision of social services), and police treatment of racial groups. Our primary independent variable of interest is racial self-classification, defined as White-Black, White-Asian, White, Black, or Asian. For the attitudinal variables, we estimate ordered logistic regression models that account for age, education, gender, income, region, salience of religion, relative linked fate, salience of race relative to nonracial identities, and relative racial closeness.3 Results Table 1 presents the linked fate, political partisanship, and ideologies of the five racial groups after weighting the sample to population benchmarks. As hypothesized, despite their self-classification as both White and minority, multiracials are far more likely to feel that their identity is inextricably linked to their minority background than to their White background. Among White-Asians, 70% express linked fate to Asians, compared to 57% who feel the same toward Whites. For White-Blacks, the minority-majority gap in linked fate is even wider; 78% express linked fate to Blacks, relative to 44% toward Whites. Chi-square tests indicate that multiracials’ perceptions of linked fate to Whites are significantly lower than that of monoracial Whites, but their linked fate to their respective monoracial minority groups are no different from those expressed by monoracial members of that minority group. In line with our expectations, the racial minority linked fate differential between the two multiracial groups is statistically significant, indicating that White-Blacks more strongly perceive a linked fate with Blacks than White-Asians do with Asians.4 Table 1 also shows that multiracials identify more as Democrats than as Republicans: the Democratic advantage is especially large (41 points) for White-Blacks. In addition, multiracials are more likely to identify as liberal, and less likely to identify as conservative, than all monoracial groups. Moreover, the group that most identifies as both liberal and Democrat—as “sorted” Democrats—is White-Asians. Sorted Democrats are particularly likely to take more extreme left-oriented stances on issues (Iyengar and Westwood 2015); in line with this, we find that White-Asians hold the most liberal cultural views, with two-thirds supporting both same-sex marriage and access to abortion (see table A-1). Blacks, the least partisan sorted group, are also the most conservative on cultural issues, which produces a wide gap between them and White-Blacks, who report considerably greater support for both of these issues (+20 points). These general patterns in cultural attitudes persist, net of demographic differences. Figure 1, which presents differences in predicted probabilities between each multiracial group and their component monoracial minority group, indicates that White-Asians are about 12 percentage points more supportive of cultural issues than Asians and that White-Blacks are likewise more supportive than Blacks, after accounting for covariates. Figure 2 presents opinion differences between multiracials and Whites; in terms of cultural issues, White-Asians are more liberal than Whites, while White-Blacks express attitudes that are comparable to Whites, all else being equal. Turning to measures of social welfare, we find that whereas majorities of White-Blacks and Blacks express support, just over one-third of White-Asians and Asians, and only about one-quarter of Whites do so (table A-1). Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate that after adjusting for potential confounders, White-Asians’ social welfare views are comparable to both Asians and Whites, while White-Blacks express views akin to Blacks and vastly more liberal than Whites. Finally, when it comes to an issue that is pointedly racial in nature—police treatment of racial groups—we find a wide disparity (see table A-1). Whereas half of Whites think the police are doing well treating racial groups equally, White-Blacks and Blacks hold the police in very low regard: 44% and 39%, respectively, believe the police are doing a “poor” job. White-Asians’ and Asians’ views of the police are more moderate. Figure 1 shows that, after accounting for covariates, multiracials’ perceptions of police treatment are comparable to those of their monoracial minority group. Figure 2 attests that multiracials are more liberal than Whites on this issue, and that the gap in opinion between Whites and White-Blacks is particularly large—roughly twice that between Whites and White-Asians. Explaining multiracials’ attitudes All told, our results support our theoretical expectations that multiracials share views akin to their component minority race on social welfare and policing.5 That White-Asians express especially liberal attitudes on abortion and same-sex marriage also supports our hypothesis that multiracial identification is associated with a distinctly progressive outlook on cultural political issues. Challenging our hypotheses somewhat is the finding that, although White-Blacks are more culturally progressive than Blacks, they share Whites’ cultural attitudes. Interestingly, White-Blacks’ sense of minority group linked fate significantly predicts more liberal views on these so-called “moral issues”—an effect that is absent among Blacks (see table A-5). This suggests that for people who see themselves as both Black and White, a feeling of minority racial consciousness is associated with more expansive and accepting views that translate beyond issues of race to individual rights and liberties. As we posited, minority linked fate, minority group closeness, and racial identity salience often predict multiracials’ political attitudes. In particular, White-Asians and White-Blacks alike consistently draw upon the belief that their individual prospects are tied to the success of their minority race (see tables A-5–A-7). Minority racial identity and group consciousness are especially meaningful for White-Blacks, who, like Blacks, have traditionally been regarded not as individuals but as members of an oppressed minority group (Davis 2001). White-Blacks’ minority linked fate, as well as their minority group closeness and race salience, matter especially for the explicitly racial topic of policing, which is fitting given heavy patrolling of Black neighborhoods, high-profile extrajudicial killings of Black Americans, and activism in this area. Importantly, “multiracial” is not monolithic. Compared to White-Blacks, White-Asians are more tempered in their perceptions of police racial bias and government social support, are more likely to identify as Republican, and rate higher on linked fate with Whites. Thus on the measures we examine, White-Asians look more like Whites than do White-Blacks—a sign of the closer social proximity between Whites and Asians (than between Whites and Blacks) and the differing histories and experiences that shape White-Asians’ identities and attitudes. Nonetheless, both multiracial groups are far more inclined to call themselves Democrats than Republicans and identify as liberal at levels that exceed that of their minority race. White-Asians are also especially progressive on cultural issues.6 And because Asian Americans encounter different kinds of prejudices from those of Blacks, there are some areas, such as immigration, in which the opinion gap between Whites and White-Asians is likely wider than that between Whites and White-Blacks. Future work should examine how multiracial subgroups’ distinctive experiences with exclusion and xenophobia politicize their component identities on a broader array of policies. Conclusions Today the United States is as divided as ever along partisan and racial lines. This pattern of reinforcing or “sorted” cleavages is known to strengthen animus between in-group and out-group members (Iyengar and Westwood 2015). For Whites, racial identity has become increasingly prominent, fueled by concerns about rising minority populations and perceived threats to Anglo-Saxon American culture (Jardina 2019). We have shown that White-Asian and White-Black multiracials do not seek to “escape” the status deprivation of their minority race by affiliating with and adopting the attitudes of Whites. Politically, these individuals are far more likely to see their fates as linked to minorities and tend to behave as such. Based on the parties’ current positions, we contend that expansion in these multiracial populations is most likely to benefit the Democratic Party, which offers an ideological and value-based affinity that resonates with multiracials. If growing numbers of multiracials turn to the Democrats, partisan and racial identities will become ever more intertwined. We have focused here on White-Asians and White-Blacks, the two largest multiracial subgroups in the United States. But currently one-quarter of US multiracials identify with multiple minority groups, and prior research suggests that such individuals feel especially marginalized and profess a social justice–oriented political identity (Davenport 2018). We thus believe that the inclusion of non-White multiracials would bolster our argument that growth in the multiracial population will benefit the Democratic Party, though this is a topic that future work should investigate more fully."
19,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA06-2022-JOP.txt," We contribute to literature in public opinion on policy feedback effects by examining how the existence of a women’s police station (WPS) in the place of residence influences citizens’ attitudes toward gender-based violence. With a focus on WPS, we argue that public policies implemented at the local level that criminalize violence against women (VAW) and increase survivors’ access to specialized services are particularly likely to promote attitudes among men that condemn VAW. We find that, in Brazil, men are more likely to reject VAW and support bystander intervention in municipalities with WPS, especially if WPS have been operating for a long time. Further analyses suggest that these findings are neither endogenous nor merely driven by social desirability bias or a deterrence effect. Men’s improved attitudes go hand in hand with lower rates of intimate partner violence. The results have important implications for the implementation of public policies to prevent VAW. Violence against women (VAW) is a chronic human rights violation across the world. In 2017 alone about 87,000 women were killed on account of their gender worldwide (UNODC 2018). More than 58% of these femicides were committed by an intimate partner or a family member. From 2012 to 2017, the number of femicides related to domestic violence increased by 11% (UNODC 2018), with Africa and Latin America showing the largest increase. Beyond the tragic loss of women’s lives and the adverse consequences for women’s health, VAW poses a high cost for society as a whole, including lower productivity and social capital (Morrison, Ellsberg, and Bott 2007). The cost of intimate partner violence (IPV) as a proportion of the global gross domestic product (GDP) is about 27 times higher than the combined cost of terrorism, civil war, and international conflict (Fearon and Hoeffler 2015). Empirical studies consistently show that violence-supportive beliefs stemming from sexist attitudes largely drive the perpetration of VAW (e.g., Flood 2011; Peacock and Barker 2014). The incidence of VAW tends to be higher in contexts where there is widespread tolerance toward VAW (e.g., Flood and Pease 2009). Since men are mostly responsible for gender-based crimes, transforming men’s attitudes toward VAW is particularly important for its prevention (e.g., Flood 2011). Drawing from literature in public opinion on policy feedback effects, we theorize that the implementation of women’s police stations (WPS) can help cultivate social norms among men supportive of safer environments for women. WPS constitute an important public policy response to demands from civil society for state action against VAW. Feminist organizations and transnational advocacy groups have historically mobilized to make the state accountable for VAW and responsible for advocating social norms that reject gender-based violence (e.g., Htun and Weldon 2012, 2018; Medie and Walsh 2019). One of the first steps in this struggle was to promote gender egalitarian attitudes among political elites and press state actors to recognize VAW as a crime. As a result of these efforts, countries have endorsed international conventions that recognize VAW as a state responsibility and a problem that should be penalized by the law. The 1992 UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and subsequent international treaties have made calls for the adoption of legislation and implementation of public policies that ensure the protection of women against gender-based violence. Extant literature suggests that public policies can serve as instruments for the diffusion of social norms supportive of a world free of VAW (e.g., Kittilson 2010). Following the adoption of international conventions, countries across the globe have adopted VAW policies. However, there is great variation in the types of policies adopted and their extent of implementation. An important line of research has examined why some countries implement comprehensive VAW polices while others do not (e.g., Franceschet 2010; Htun and Weldon 2012). Yet, we still know little about the kinds of public policies that are more likely to promote progressive social norms on VAW among the public. Studies that explore the attitudinal effects of state-sponsored VAW awareness campaigns and school interventions that target boys have yielded mixed findings (e.g., Peacock and Barker 2014). However, the attitudinal effects of a public policy aimed at addressing VAW remain largely understudied: WPS. Since Brazil inaugurated the first WPS in the world more than three decades ago, at least nine countries in Latin America (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, and Uruguay) and eight others outside the region (Ghana, India, Kosovo, Liberia, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Uganda) have implemented this policy (Hautzinger 2016; United Nations Women 2011). WPS are specialized police units in charge of preventing, investigating, and punishing VAW. They are designed to offer services “by and for women” (Hautzinger 2016). In practice, because of the low numbers of women in the police, WPS are typically only partially staffed by female police officers (United Nations Women 2011). In addition, service quality is often far from ideal (e.g., Hautzinger 2007; Morrison et al. 2007). Yet, compared to regular police stations, WPS increase survivors’ access to specialized services, including medical services, domestic violence shelters, and restraining orders (e.g., Lima and Souza 2009). Moreover, quantitative evidence shows that WPS have reduced VAW rates in Brazil and Peru and increased reporting to the police in Peru and India (Amaral, Bhalotra, and Prakash 2019; Kavanaugh, Sviatschi, and Trako 2019; Perova and Reynolds 2017). In this article, we argue that WPS promote progressive attitudes toward VAW among men, thereby addressing one of the underlying causes of gender-based violence. WPS increase the police’s role in the prevention and punishment of VAW, highlighting its criminal nature. As such, we posit that in localities with a WPS, men are more likely to condemn VAW and believe that it is never justified. By lowering men’s tolerance toward gender-based violence and providing specialized services to survivors, WPS are also likely to increase men’s support for bystander intervention. When there is a WPS in town, men are more likely to perceive that calling the police to report VAW is worthwhile, thereby reinforcing bystander intervention attitudes. In short, we argue that, as WPS criminalize VAW and increase survivors’ access to specialized services, WPS promote progressive attitudes toward VAW among men, particularly if a WPS has been operating for a long time in the place of residence. Importantly, we theorize that these feedback effects are possible because WPS are highly visible in the towns where they have been enacted, making citizens aware of WPS’ existence and increasing their likelihood of receiving a clear message: VAW is a crime. The empirical evidence lends strong support to our hypotheses. In the context of Brazil, we find that men are more likely to reject VAW and support bystander intervention, the longer a WPS has been operating in a municipality. Further analyses indicate that these findings are neither endogenous nor driven by social desirability bias or a deterrence effect, suggesting that WPS contribute to the internalization of values supportive of a safer environment for women. Indeed, additional analyses suggest that improved attitudes do translate into improved behavior, as the literature posits (e.g., Flood and Pease 2009). We show that women are less likely to experience IPV in municipalities with a WPS compared to women in places without one. Moreover, we do not find evidence that men’s improved attitudes are merely explained by fear of punishment. Our theoretical insights and findings contribute to the literature in public opinion on policy feedback effects and scholarly work that examines the role of government in the eradication of VAW. The findings have important policy implications. They suggest that an integral strategy to eradicate VAW should address its underlying causes, and this can be facilitated by police reforms that prioritize the enactment and sustainability of WPS across national territories. To reap WPS’ benefits on attitudes toward gender-based violence, WPS must be permanent and citizens should perceive them as an important resource available to survivors of VAW. Violence against Women Policies and Feedback Effects on Public Opinion Scholars have theorized and empirically shown that public policy implementation influences mass attitudes and opinions—thereby generating policy feedback effects (e.g., Campbell 2012; Mettler 2019; Mettler and Soss 2004). Public policy implementation shapes public opinion on an array of issues, including policy preferences (e.g., Soroka and Wlezien 2010), state institutions (e.g., Weaver and Lerman 2010), and policy beneficiaries (e.g., Mettler and Soss 2004). More relevant for the focus of this article, studies have also demonstrated that public policies generate feedback effects on social norms (e.g., Pacheco 2013). When the state implements a policy, it signals what behaviors are considered appropriate in society. As Pacheco (2013, 715) puts it, public policies can affect public opinion “by educating the public about what is socially acceptable.” Recent empirical studies lend support to this proposition. For instance, Kreitzer, Hamilton, and Tolbert (2014) find that passing legislation to allow same-sex marriage generates positive attitudes toward sexual minorities. Similarly, the literature suggests that gender policies shape citizens’ normative views about women’s role in society. McDonagh (2010), for example, theorizes that public policies that promote equality between men and women cultivate the view that women are suitable for public office. Research investigating the effects of public policies that promote dual-earner families, such as the provision of child care, posits that these policies foster citizen support for women’s participation in the job market (Sjöberg 2004). Scholars also theorize that state-led initiatives on VAW can generate feedback effects on citizens’ attitudes. As Kittilson (2010, 217) states, “the adoption and expansion of national policies on issues such as … violence against women carry important messages to the electorate.” We argue that the implementation of VAW policies signals that VAW lays outside the range of socially acceptable behavior. Thus, policies aimed at protecting women from gender-based violence can promote more progressive attitudes toward VAW. This theoretical proposition raises important questions about the mechanisms that explain this effect and the type of public policies that are particularly likely to shape social norms. Next, we develop our theoretical framework, arguing that the implementation of WPS is a particularly effective strategy to maximize policy feedback effects on attitudes supportive of women’s safety. Explaining Policy Feedback Effects on Attitudes toward Gender-Based Violence Previous literature suggests that, when asked to express their thoughts on a given issue, citizens form an opinion through a “top of the head” process relying on heuristic information from political elites (Zaller 1992), including policy implementation. Conceived in this way, public policies shape public opinion through a top-down signaling mechanism in which the state transmits important messages to citizens (Gusmano, Schlesinger, and Thomas 2002). Public policy implementation can serve as a source of information that generates “interpretative effects” among the public (Pierson 1993, 626). Taking into account these theoretical insights, we argue that, when asked to emit an opinion on VAW, citizens resort to elite cues drawn from VAW policies. That is, VAW policies can result in more progressive attitudes toward VAW by signaling that VAW is never justified or acceptable. However, we argue that this signaling mechanism is more likely to occur in the short term, when policies are relatively new. In the long run, citizens are more likely to internalize policy messages rather than simply use them as heuristic information (Kreitzer et al. 2014; Pacheco 2013). As time passes, public policies can shape social norms through a learning mechanism that results in more deep-rooted attitudes (Kreitzer et al. 2014). When a given policy has been implemented for a long time, citizens are more likely to know about its existence and purpose, resulting in stronger policy feedback effects and more deep-seated beliefs. Consequently, we posit that long-lived policies on VAW are more likely to promote social norms and result in more entrenched values that condemn gender-based violence, compared to newly implemented policies. Our theoretical framework also predicts that VAW policies will have differential feedback effects between men and women. The signaling and learning mechanisms described above will primarily take place among men. Previous literature suggests that public policies can aid citizens to form opinions on issues that are of primary concern for policy targets. Individuals are less likely to have crystallized views on matters that disproportionately affect others. Consequently, when asked their opinion on issues that appear distant, citizens are more likely to resort to information drawn from elite cues (e.g., Morgan and Buice 2013). This suggests that men are more likely to resort to information from gender equality policies to form an opinion on problems that predominantly affect women. By contrast, compared to men, women are more likely to have firm opinions on issues that affect them directly (e.g., Barnes and Córdova 2016; Mansbridge 1999; Morgan and Buice 2013). Thus, we anticipate that men will be more likely to condemn VAW when the state implements public policies on VAW than when no policies are in place. Women in general are less likely than men to justify VAW, independent of policy implementation. In short, VAW policies are particularly relevant to educate men about women’s right to live in a society that protects them from violence. Although the theoretical framework described above is general and can inform the study of feedback effects derived from VAW policies more broadly, we identify WPS as a public policy particularly likely to improve men’s attitudes toward gender-based violence in the short and long run. More specifically, we theorize that WPS can lower men’s tolerance toward VAW and result in higher support for bystander intervention, especially when WPS have been operating for a long time. The nature and design features of WPS maximize their potential to result in these outcomes. Building on the theoretical framework laid out above, we proceed to identify mechanisms through which WPS can shape men’s views on VAW. Women’s Police Stations and Effects on Attitudes toward Gender-Based Violence Citizens rely largely on the actions of judicial institutions to form opinions on what constitutes a crime and the seriousness of a crime (e.g., Salazar et al. 2003). Consequently, when the state criminalizes VAW, it shapes social norms on gender-based violence by educating the public that VAW constitutes wrongdoing (Salazar et al. 2003). We argue that, when the state takes strong action against gender-based violence and gets the police actively involved in bringing perpetrators to justice, it signals that VAW is a serious crime. We posit that the establishment of a WPS within the local area transmits such a message, resulting in lower tolerance toward VAW, particularly among men. Moreover, as WPS result in lower tolerance toward VAW, WPS are also likely to prompt men to be more supportive of bystander intervention. Knowing the VAW is a crime, men are more likely to reject VAW and consequently believe that anyone witnessing VAW should report it to the police. A “resource effect” (Campbell 2012) can also reinforce support for bystander intervention. As Pierson (1993) suggests, public policies can facilitate access to resources that make certain activities worthwhile. WPS criminalize VAW but also increase access to specialized services, which can lead citizens to perceive that denouncing VAW to the police can be beneficial to survivors. Thus, WPS can result in higher support for bystander intervention in the towns where they have been enacted, particularly among men who in the absence of a WPS would likely express lower support. In short, WPS can promote bystander intervention attitudes among men via increased intolerance toward VAW and a resource effect. Yet, a resource effect is likely to occur insofar as men perceive that WPS are more effective to handle VAW than regular police stations. If men perceive that WPS serve survivors better, this can reinforce men’s support for bystander intervention in towns with a WPS. Although WPS can trigger a resource effect on support for bystander intervention among women, we expect this effect to be stronger among men. As explained previously, VAW policies are more likely to influence men’s beliefs on VAW than women’s. In sum, our theoretical discussion indicates that the central role that the police play in the criminalization of VAW and in the provision of specialized services makes WPS particularly likely to promote intolerance toward VAW and create support for bystander intervention among men. In addition, the theoretical insights discussed previously suggest that, the longer a WPS has been operating in a given locality, the stronger these feedback effects will be. Further, we argue that the design features of WPS make this policy highly visible among the public, which maximizes WPS’ potential to generate feedback effects. Public policies that are salient to citizens are more likely to influence citizens’ attitudes (e.g., Campbell 2012; Mettler 2019; Pierson 1993). Three reinforcing characteristics make WPS visible, and therefore salient, among the public: (1) WPS are implemented at the local level, (2) WPS require the building of physical infrastructure, and (3) as part of their functions, WPS disseminate information on the services they provide. These characteristics facilitate citizens’ knowledge of WPS’ existence and purpose. Moreover, this knowledge is likely to be more widespread when WPS have been operating in towns for a long time. Citizens are more likely to be aware of government-provided local services on VAW than about the provision of similar services in more distant and centralized locations. This is especially the case when offices where services are provided are visible. WPS are enacted in local government jurisdictions and necessitate the creation of physical spaces for police officers and other staff to work. WPS’ offices typically have visible signs outside of their facilities with their proper names (e.g., Delegacia de Defensa da Mulher de Itapevi, São Paulo, Brazil). By contrast, in an effort to protect survivors, the location of other services provided to victims, such as domestic violence shelters, are rarely advertised and consequently unknown by the general public. In short, we identity the existence of physical infrastructure at the local level that advertises specialized police services for women as one of the mechanisms through which citizens learn about the operation of a WPS in their place of residence. From our extensive fieldwork in two Latin American countries (Brazil and El Salvador), we also learned that WPS raise public awareness of the services they provide through the media and police officers’ visits to marginalized areas. For example, in Brazil, radio stations in São Paulo broadcast ads that provide information on the services that the local WPS provide and how the public can get in contact to denounce VAW (June 2019). In Porto Alegre, one of the head police officers of a WPS explained, “officers organize regular visits in different regions of the city to inform citizens of WPS’ services, what gender-based violence looks like, and where people can go to press charges. The day following such talks is the busiest at the WPS due to high demand” (July 2019). Our fieldwork in Brazil supports previous studies’ conclusion that “one of the major successes of specialist stations for women is how they made the general public more aware of the issue of violence against women” in the cities where they operate (Wilding 2012, 70). Our theoretical discussion leads us to draw two main testable hypotheses about the likely feedback effects of WPS on attitudes toward VAW: H1. Men who live in towns with a WPS will be more likely to reject VAW and express bystander intervention attitudes than their counterparts in towns without a WPS. H2. The longer a WPS has been enacted in the place of residence, the higher men’s probability of rejecting VAW and expressing bystander intervention attitudes will be. Case Study: Women’s Police Stations in Brazil Brazil constitutes an ideal case study to test our hypotheses. Although the majority of municipalities still lack a WPS, it is the country with the largest number of WPS in Latin America and the first one to establish a WPS in the world (United Nations Women 2011). As such, focusing on Brazil allows us to maximize variation in the existence and age of WPS across municipalities. The first WPS was established in 1985 in the municipality of São Paulo as a result of feminist mobilization that pushed the state government to address VAW (Hautzinger 2007). Since then, the number of WPS has increased across the country. Yet, their geographic coverage is still very low. By 2018, there were about 460 WPS operating across the national territory, with presence in only 8.3% of the 5,570 municipalities in the country (IBGE 2019). The expansion of WPS in recent years has largely been the result of the federal government’s adoption of comprehensive legislation on domestic violence in 2006, known as the Maria da Penha law. The law mandates the coordination between the federal, state, and municipal governments in the implementation of programs to eradicate VAW. It explicitly requires the implementation of WPS, which constitute the main entry point for survivors’ access to the justice system and VAW services (United Nations Women 2011). The civil police, an institution centralized at the state level, is mainly responsible for the operation of WPS. However, WPS need to coordinate their work with other institutions on the ground, including municipal governments. Typically, WPS are created as a result of partnerships between the state and municipal governments, since the latter often provide the physical space where WPS operate (Pasinato and Santos 2008). To ensure the implementation of the Maria da Penha law, some municipal governments have adopted legislation on VAW, promoting collaboration between WPS and municipal governments in the provision of VAW services. For example, Rio de Janeiro’s municipal law establishes that the local government should guarantee the creation and operation of domestic violence shelters, which is a key asset for WPS to protect victims. In brief, WPS play a fundamental role in the implementation of the Maria da Penha law and often do so in coordination with state and municipal governments. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed description of the Maria da Penha law and legislation on VAW at other levels of government as well as their implications for the functioning of WPS. Survivors of VAW turn to WPS to press charges against their aggressors, request a restraining order, and seek access to services, such as medical and psychological attention and women’s shelters (Hautzinger 2007). The majority of complaints tend to involve IPV, but WPS also investigate other gender-based crimes, including defamation and femicides. However, the provision of services is often far from ideal. Most WPS are understaffed, operate under limited hours, and have scarce resources, and officers often do not receive gender sensitization training (Hautzinger 2007). Moreover, the low number of women in the police limits their expansion and operation. Despite their limited coverage and far from ideal service quality, WPS are the main institutional channel through which VAW is addressed in Brazil (Santos 2010). Even though survivors who live in municipalities without a WPS can press charges against their aggressors in regular police stations, abused women are less likely to receive the attention they need in these stations compared to WPS. In regular stations, gender-based violence is often perceived as a less serious crime and consequently not given priority (Lima and Souza 2009). Importantly, citizens recognize WPS as more effective than regular police stations to address VAW, making the generation of a “resource effect” likely, as we argue. Our analysis of data from the 2013 Data Popular and the Instituto Patricia Galvão survey revealed that over 80% of men and women identify WPS as the most effective government program to address domestic violence in the country. Not surprisingly, when asked where victims of IPV should seek help first, a much higher percentage of men and women spontaneously responded WPS (48%) than regular police stations (27%) or family and friends (21%). Moreover, only about 3% mentioned any other governmental VAW service. These descriptive statistics suggest that WPS are likely to promote support for bystander intervention through a resource effect, as we posit. Citizens perceive WPS as more suited to deal with gender-based violence than regular police stations and other public institutions. Data, Measurement, and Method To test our hypotheses, we use data from the 2013 Data Popular and the Instituto Patricia Galvão survey, which is nationally representative of the adult population in urban areas. The sample consists of 1,501 face-to-face interviews carried out in 100 randomly selected municipalities across the five regions of the country. The strategy for the randomization of municipalities ensured the representation of large municipalities in the sample but also the inclusion of small municipalities. In the sample, 46% of municipalities have a WPS, and 49.6% of interviews were conducted in those municipalities. We combine the survey data with municipal-level indicators from various sources.1 Data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics allow us to identify municipalities with a WPS. We complement these data with information from the National Secretariat of Public Safety on the number of years each WPS has been functioning in a given municipality. The first dependent variable is a survey item that examines respondents’ degree of intolerance toward VAW. On a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means “strongly disagree” and 5 “strongly agree,” respondents were asked how much they agree with the following well-known Brazilian saying, “women should not be beaten even with a flower” (Em mulher não se bate nem com uma flor). We find that 66.5% of men strongly agree with this statement, while 78.5% of women do, suggesting that men in general are more tolerant of VAW than women. The second dependent variable examines respondents’ bystander intervention attitudes. On the same 1–5 scale, respondents were asked the extent to which they agree that, “if a person sees a man beating a woman, he or she should report it to the police.” The percentage of men and women strongly agreeing with this statement is 61.4 and 67.5, respectively—depicting a smaller but statistically significant gender gap ( p < .05 ). Our two dependent variables measure related but distinct attitudes toward VAW.2 Both entail disapproving VAW, but the latter involves going a step further—calling for citizen action to stop VAW and thus perceiving it as a public issue that concerns everyone. At the individual level, our main independent variable is gender, coded 1 for female and 0 for male respondents. At the municipal level, the first core independent variable is Women’s Police Stations (WPS), coded 1 if a WPS has been established in a municipality or 0 otherwise. The second independent variable indicates the number of years a WPS had been functioning in a given municipality at the time of the public opinion survey. Most municipalities in Brazil only have one WPS, but for those few in our data set with more than one, we estimated the number of years since WPS creation using information for the oldest one. The age of WPS across municipalities ranges from 2 to 28 years, with municipalities without a WPS coded 0.3 To test hypothesis 1, we include an interaction term in our models between the gender and WPS variables. Similarly, to test hypothesis 2, we interact gender with years since WPS creation. Our models also control for a series of variables at the municipal and individual levels. At the municipal level, we control for the adoption of VAW legislation. As mentioned above, some municipal governments, such as Rio de Janeiro, have passed legislation to promote the implementation of the Maria da Penha law and consequently support local efforts to eradicate VAW. Since it is possible that WPS have been established primarily in municipalities that have passed VAW laws, we control for the adoption of VAW legislation and interact this variable with gender. At the municipal level, our models also control for the existence of regular police stations. Although most municipalities in Brazil do have a regular police station, we include this variable in our models to rule out the possibility that the effect of WPS is driven by the existence of a regular police station. In addition, our models control for municipalities’ population size, femicide rate, and GDP per capita. Our theory suggests that WPS are important drivers of feedback effects on attitudes toward VAW at the local level, independent of perceptions of state performance as a whole. That is, in the absence of local police units that target VAW specifically, positive feelings toward the state’s role in improving VAW will not be sufficient to significantly improve attitudes toward VAW, particularly support for bystander intervention. As such, at the individual level our models control for citizens’ perceptions that the state supports victims to denounce VAW. We also control for presidential approval. At the time of the survey, Brazil had a leftist female president, Dilma Rousseff. Previous studies suggest that the presence and support of women in high public offices is likely to improve attitudes toward women in general (e.g., Morgan and Buice 2013). We use this variable as a proxy for support for both a female president and a leftist political leader.4 At the individual level, we also account for gender views identified in the literature as important predictors of attitudes toward VAW. We include a survey item on support for traditional gender roles, which asks whether “women’s role is to take care of household chores.” We also control for respondents’ perceptions that IPV is a private issue and views of gender-based discrimination. The latter corresponds to a survey item that captures opinions on whether there is discrimination against women in society. Finally, the models include demographic and socioeconomic indicators at the individual level: education, perceived social class, household wealth, age, race, number of children, and marital status. To test our hypotheses, we estimate two-level models that account for the nested structure of the data (e.g., Snijders and Bosker 2012).5 We take into account clustering effects at the municipal level in the estimation of standard errors. Since the two dependent variables of interest are ordinal, we estimate ordered logistic multilevel models with random effects for the intercept at the municipal level. Results We first examine the results for the first dependent variable, intolerance toward VAW. As expected, model 1 in Table 1, the baseline model, shows that, on average, women are more likely to reject VAW than men ( p < .001 ). Moreover, model 1 shows that the existence of a WPS in the place of residence does not appear to have an effect on citizens’ likelihood of rejecting VAW, at least on average. However, model 2 shows a negative and statistically significant interaction between the gender and WPS variables ( p < .01 ). Since all constituent terms of an interaction need to be taken into account, we estimate predicted probabilities and present the results graphically. Figure 1A shows mean predicted probabilities separately for men and women when the WPS variable takes a value of 1 or 0. We then estimate the average gender gap at each value of the WPS variable (1 or 0). The gap is the difference in the mean predicted probabilities between men and women, with higher values indicating a higher probability of rejecting VAW among women than men. Figure 1B presents the gender gap in municipalities with and without a WPS and its respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs; represented by dashed lines). If CIs cross the zero line, the gender gap is not statistically significant. Figure 1A shows the mean predicted probability of strongly agreeing that women should not be beaten (i.e., scoring a value of 5 on the 1–5 scale). For men living in municipalities without a WPS, the predicted probability is only about 63.8%, while for women it is 82.5%. In municipalities with a WPS, however, men’s probability of rejecting VAW becomes similar to women’s. In towns with a WPS, men’s probability is about 80.6%. Consistent with hypothesis 1, this represents a statistically significant increase among men of 16.8 percentage points. Although we observe a slight increase in women’s probability as well, we find that this effect is not statistically significant. As the theory that sustains hypothesis 1 suggests, men are more likely than women to rely on information drawn from WPS to form an opinion on VAW. Figure 1B shows that, although in municipalities without a WPS there is a statistically significant gender gap in the probability of rejecting VAW of almost 19 points, the gap is no longer statistically significant in municipalities with a WPS. Models 3–4 in Table 1 show the results when we use the years since WPS creation variable. Once again, when we use this variable, we do not observe that the existence of a WPS has a statistically significant average effect (see model 3). It is only when we account for possible gender effects that we find statistically significant results. In model 4, there is a statistically significant interaction effect between the age of WPS and gender ( p < .01 ). Based on model 4, figure 2 depicts the mean predicted probabilities when we use the years since WPS creation variable. Consistent with hypothesis 2, we find that the probability of strongly agreeing that women should not be beaten goes up as the number of years of WPS creation increases, but mostly among men (see fig. 2A). On average, men who live in municipalities where WPS were first enacted are around 20% more likely to strongly reject VAW compared to men in municipalities with a newly established WPS or without one. By contrast, we do not observe a statistically significant effect for women. Figure 2B shows that the gender gap in the probability of rejecting VAW decreases as the number of years of WPS creation increases. However, the gap remains statistically significant in municipalities with relatively old WPS. It is only in municipalities with WPS older than 18 years that the gender gap closes (i.e., CIs cross the line set at zero). Yet, it is important to mention that even in municipalities that have had a WPS for a long time, at least 15% of men and women still condone VAW. We now turn to the results associated with our second dependent variable. Models 5 and 7 in Table 1, the baseline models, only shows weak differences in bystander intervention attitudes between men and women. Similarly, in these models the coefficients of the WPS and years since WPS creation variables do not depict strong independent effects. However, for this dependent variable, we also find important gender effects associated with the existence of a WPS and the number of years it has been operating in a municipality. Models 2 and 8 reveal a negative and statistically significant interaction effect between gender and the WPS and years since WPS creation variables, respectively. The existence of a WPS in a municipality positively influences men’s support for bystander intervention, and this effect is stronger, the longer a WPS has been functioning. We present these results in figures 3 and 4. The results resemble those presented above. We find that in municipalities with a WPS, men are 81.7% likely to strongly agree that a person should call the police if he or she witnesses VAW. By contrast, this percentage is only 56.0% for men living in municipalities without a WPS (see fig. 3A). This represents a statistically significant difference of 25.7 points. Although we observe an upward trend for women, this effect is not statistically significant. Moreover, although there is a statistically significant gender gap in bystander attitudes in municipalities without a WPS of more than 13 points, in municipalities with a WPS the gap disappears (see fig. 3B). In figure 4, we also observe that these effects are stronger in municipalities that have had a WPS for a longer time. It is only when a WPS is at least 14 years old that the gender gap is no longer statistically significant (i.e., at this point CIs cross the zero line in fig. 4B). Here too it is important to mention that bystander intervention attitudes are not universal even in municipalities that have had a WPS for a long time. In sum, the findings in Table 1 give strong support to our expectation that the existence of a WPS at the local level shapes men’s opinions on the acceptability of VAW and bystander intervention, particularly when WPS have been functioning for a long time. Importantly, we do not find evidence that passing municipal-level VAW legislation by itself leads to improved attitudes toward VAW. As shown in Table 1, in addition to WPS, other contextual and individual-level factors have an independent contribution in the formation of attitudes toward VAW. We observe that higher economic development at the municipal level, as measured by GDP per capita, is associated with a lower likelihood of rejecting VAW. Moreover, consistent with the findings of previous studies, we find that support for traditional gender roles is correlated with a lower probability of rejecting VAW. We also find that individuals who perceive discrimination against women are more likely to reject gendered violence and support bystander intervention. Perceiving that the state supports victims of VAW also predicts our two dependent variables, but exerts a stronger effect on bystander intervention attitudes. In addition, believing that VAW is a private issue lowers the probability of supporting bystander intervention. Finally, approval of President Dilma Rousseff’s government does not influence our dependent variables, suggesting that support for a female or leftist political leader is not correlated with progressive attitudes toward VAW. Moreover, none of the demographic and socioeconomic variables exert strong effects on our two dependent variables. Social Desirability and Deterrence Effects In this section, we examine whether the findings presented above are merely the result of social desirability bias or likely to reflect entrenched values. In towns where WPS have been operating for a long time, knowing that the state considers VAW a crime, men might simply provide a politically correct answer when asked their opinion on VAW. Alternatively, men in those towns might have embraced more progressive attitudes toward VAW, reflecting more deep-rooted social values. To determine whether WPS influence men’s attitudes in a substantive way, it is important to examine their behavior. We explore empirically whether the theorized effects derived from WPS go hand in hand with a lower probability of IPV. The survey data allow us to examine two indicators: personal knowledge of a victim of IPV and personal experience with IPV (tables A2 and A3). Disturbingly, over 50% of survey respondents report knowing an IPV victim. To explore whether this number varies depending on the age of WPS, we estimate a multilevel model that interacts this variable with gender, controlling for municipal and individual-level characteristics. We find that, on average, women are more likely to say they know a victim of IPV than are men, suggesting that victims are more open to share their experiences with other women. However, women’s probability of knowing an IPV victim varies across municipalities depending on the age of WPS creation. In municipalities without a WPS, 65.5% of women are likely to report knowing a victim of IPV (see fig. 5A). This number is 45.4% in municipalities that have had a WPS the longest. Men’s probability of knowing a victim of IPV declines slightly as the age of WPS increases, but this effect is not statistically significant. In older municipalities, men and women show a similar probability of knowing an IPV victim (fig. 5B). Similarly, we find that, on average, about 18% of women report having personally experienced IPV and that this number varies depending on whether women live in a municipality with or without a WPS (fig. 6). The total sample for this analysis consists of 688 women with 124 of them reporting a personal experience with IPV. Because of the relatively small sample size, we use the dichotomous indicator of WPS as independent variable ( WPS = 1 or 0), instead of years since WPS creation. We find that, in municipalities without a WPS, the probability of experiencing IPV is 24.7%, while this number is 13.6% in municipalities with a WPS, representing a statistically significant difference of 11.1 points ( p < .05 ). Our results are consistent with the findings of previous studies showing that WPS have improved women’s safety in Brazil. Perova and Reynolds (2017) find that WPS have decreased femicide rates by about 17% in metropolitan municipalities. We show that the incidence of IPV is lower in municipalities with a WPS. Taken together, the evidence suggests that feedback effects on attitudes toward VAW are unlikely to be merely the result of social desirability—improved attitudes toward VAW manifest in improved behavior. Still, more progressive VAW attitudes and lower levels of VAW in municipalities with a WPS can be the result of a deterrence effect rather than deep-rooted values that condemn VAW. When the state implements policies that punish perpetrators of VAW, men learn that those who support and engage in this kind of violence can face costly sanctions, including incarceration. Consequently, public policies that criminalize VAW and enforce the law can arguably create strong incentives among men to disassociate themselves from gender-based violence out of fear of being blamed and punished for wrongdoing. As such, a deterrence effect, rather than the internalization of values, might be the main underlying force driving the theorized effects. We test this possibility empirically using an item in the survey that examines respondents’ perceptions that the state punishes aggressions against women. If a deterrence effect were explaining the link between the existence of a WPS and improved VAW attitudes, we would find evidence that men’s perceptions that the state punishes aggressions against women mediate the effect of WPS on attitudes toward VAW. When we restrict the sample to men, we find that the perception that the state punishes aggressors does not predict attitudes toward VAW in municipalities either with or without a WPS (table A4). This null effect persists in municipalities where WPS have been operating for more than 18 years (table A5). In short, we do not find evidence that our results are explained by a deterrence effect. Additional Analyses In this section, we first check the robustness of our results to the inclusion of additional control variables. In a second step, we address the possibility of endogeneity quasi experimentally. Finally, we test empirically a core underlying assumption of our theory: citizens’ awareness of the existence of a WPS in their municipality, particularly when WPS have been operating for a long time. The effect of feminist movements and other factors One concern is that the results presented in Table 1 are confounded by other municipal-level factors that might affect both the probability of having a WPS and attitudes toward VAW. The history of feminist movements at the municipal level is one such factor. Feminist movements played an important role in lobbying the state to address VAW in Brazil, resulting in the inauguration of the first WPS in the city of São Paulo in 1985 (Hautzinger 2007; Santos 2010). Consequently, it is possible that citizens in municipalities with a long history of women’s organization are more likely to express progressive attitudes toward VAW, leading them to advocate for the expansion of WPS beyond São Paulo. As such, our results might be capturing the effect of feminist movements on attitudes toward VAW, rather than the effect of WPS. To examine this possibility, we control for two alternative indicators of women movements’ history at the municipal level. The first variable registers the age of the oldest feminist organization present in a municipality at the time of the survey. The second one is a count of the total number of protest marches led by feminist groups in a given municipality in 2013 or any year prior based on records available in Google News archives. When we replicate the statistical analyses presented in figures 1–4 and control for either of these two variables, our results remain substantively similar, suggesting that the effect of WPS is not confounded by the history or activism of feminist movements at the municipal level (tables A6 and A7). Moreover, we test the possibility that the results might be explained by feedback effects from the Maria da Penha law, rather than from WPS. We do not find evidence that this is the case. After controlling for citizens’ knowledge about the Maria da Penha law, the effect of WPS remains statistically significant (table A8). Additional analyses test the robustness of our results to alternative control variables. More specifically, our conclusions do not change if we control for homicide rates, instead of femicides, and when we control for education at the municipal level, instead of GDP per capita (tables A9 and A10).6 Addressing endogeneity Since the assignment of WPS to municipalities did not occur at random, we need to examine further the possibility that our results are driven by confounding factors or affected by reversed causality. To address endogeneity in a quasi-experimental fashion, we employ a weighting method based on propensity scores applied to multilevel modeling (e.g., Leite et al. 2015).7 First, we employ propensity score matching to obtain two groups of municipalities that are similar on a series of municipal-level covariates, except for treatment assignment: the existence of a WPS. One group has received the treatment ( WPS = 1 ), and the other serves as a control group ( WPS = 0 ). Thus, matching at the cluster level allows us to simulate the assignment of municipalities to treatment and control groups as if it had occurred at random subject to a list of observable covariates (Angrist and Pischke 2009). The estimation of a propensity score first involves selecting covariates that predict the treatment condition. Population size has been an influential factor to establish a WPS in a given municipality. The federal government has promoted the enactment of WPS in larger municipalities, albeit it has not specified a population threshold (Secretaria de Políticas para as Mulheres 2010). On average, municipalities with a WPS tend to have a larger population size than those without one, although among all municipalities with a WPS the size of the population varies drastically.8 This tendency has resulted in the concentration of WPS in municipalities with higher development levels, at least on average. Consequently, we include population size as a predictor in the propensity score equation along with GDP per capita. Moreover, to account for the possibility that WPS have been primarily established in the most dangerous cities, we also include the homicide rate for each municipality. We find that the resulting matched sample is balanced on the variables included in the propensity score, reducing bias between treatment and control groups for each of these variables by more than 95% compared to the unmatched sample (table A12). As such, we do not find that our matching strategy is making imbalance worse, as can often occur (King and Nielsen 2019). The resulting matched sample, balanced on population size, GDP per capita, and homicide rates, consists of 44 municipalities, half of them in the treatment group. The matched sample only includes small and less developed municipalities (table A13). The total number of individuals interviewed in these municipalities is 558, almost equally split in the treatment and control groups. To estimate treatment effects, we need to account for the nested structure of our data (i.e., individuals within municipalities). Consequently, we run multilevel models using the matched sample adjusted by the weight variable generated from the matching procedure (Leite et al. 2015; tables A14 and A15). The findings show that, in municipalities without a WPS, there is a gender gap in citizens’ probability of rejecting VAW and supporting bystander intervention ( p < .05 ). Yet, men’s and women’s attitudes toward VAW are similar in municipalities with a WPS, suggesting that WPS generate policy feedback effects, as we argue. As can be observed in figures 7 and 8, which graph the results of our multilevel models based on the matched sample, the results remain similar to those reported above. Moreover, when we replicate the analysis exploring the effect of WPS on personal experience with IPV using the matched sample, we find similar findings. The incidence of IPV is lower in municipalities with a WPS (table A16). Awareness of the existence of a WPS A core assumption of our theory is that citizens know about the existence of a WPS in their municipality, particularly when it has been functioning for a long time. Here we examine the validity of this assumption. We use as a dependent variable an item in the survey that asks respondents whether they know the exact location of a WPS in their municipality. After controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, we find that men’s and women’s knowledge of the location of a WPS is statistically significantly higher when WPS have been operating for a longer time ( p < .01 ). The probability of knowing the location of a WPS goes up sharply, by more than 35 percentage points, among men and women, when a WPS has been operating for a long time in the municipality. We present these results in the appendix (table A17 and fig. A1). Conclusion and Policy Implications The evidence shows that the implementation of women’s police stations (WPS) has the potential to address an important underlying cause of violence against women (VAW)—men’s attitudes toward gender-based violence. In the context of Brazil, men are more likely to reject VAW and support bystander intervention when there is a WPS in their municipality, particularly if it has been operating for a long time. Moreover, intimate partner violence (IPV) rates are lower in municipalities with a WPS compared to those without one, suggesting that WPS’ positive influence on men’s attitudes has a meaningful effect on behavior. Taken together, our statistical analyses suggest that our findings are not merely the result of an endogeneity issue, social desirability bias, or a deterrence effect. WPS have the potential to cultivate deep-rooted social norms supportive of safer environments for women. Our research supports the United Nations’ conclusion that “the greatest contribution of the WPS has been to make violence against women more visible as a public-sphere issue, a crime, and a collective matter” (United Nations Women 2011, 1). When the police take strong action to eradicate VAW and WPS are implemented across municipalities, the state sends a strong message to the public: VAW is a criminal act. As time goes by, men internalize this message and become more likely to reject VAW and adopt bystander intervention attitudes. Moreover, WPS are likely to reinforce men’s support for bystander intervention by increasing survivors’ access to specialized services. When there is a WPS in town, men are more likely to perceive that calling the police to report VAW is worthwhile. Indeed, citizens in general perceive WPS as a more effective resource to address VAW than regular police stations. WPS’ design features make policy feedback effects on attitudes toward VAW possible. Notably, WPS are salient among the public, because they are visible at the local level and their mandate often involves police officers’ engagement in awareness building on VAW in the municipalities where WPS operate. The findings of our research have important policy implications for Brazil and countries across the world tasked with the responsibility of eradicating VAW. First, our research highlights the importance of WPS implementation as part of an integral strategy to address gender-based violence. Yet, WPS can only result in substantial improvements in men’s attitudes toward VAW and lower VAW rates if WPS are permanent. As the case of Brazil shows, the sustainability of WPS depends on governments’ long-term commitment to the implementation of comprehensive VAW legislation and, therefore, the allocation of national funds to specialized policing for women. Second, our research demonstrates the importance of increasing WPS’ coverage and improving the quality of their services. Widespread implementation of WPS maximizes the chances of significant shifts in men’s attitudes toward VAW across territories and, consequently, the reduction of VAW at the national level. The provision of high-quality services is quintessential for reinforcing social norms supportive of bystander intervention and consequently promoting collective action against gender-based violence."
20,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA07-2020-POP.txt," Violence against women in politics is increasingly recognized around the world as a significant barrier to women’s political participation, following a troubling rise in reports of assault, intimidation, and abuse directed at female politicians. Yet conceptual ambiguities remain as to the exact contours of this phenomenon. In this article, we seek to strengthen its theoretical, empirical, and methodological foundations. We propose that the presence of bias against women in political roles—originating in structural violence, employing cultural violence, and resulting in symbolic violence—distinguishes this phenomenon from other forms of political violence. We identify five types of violence against women in politics—physical, psychological, sexual, economic, and semiotic—and three methodological challenges related to underreporting, comparing men’s and women’s experiences, and intersectionality. Inspired by the literature on hate crimes, we develop an empirical approach for identifying cases of violence against women in politics, offering six criteria to ascertain whether an attack was potentially motivated by gender bias. We apply this framework to analyze three cases: the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, and the murder of Jo Cox. We conclude with the negative implications of violence against women in politics and point to emerging solutions around the globe. Recent years have seen a troubling rise in reports of assault, intimidation, and abuse directed at female politicians (Krook Reference Krook 2018a). Bolivia was the first state to respond with legal reforms, passing a law criminalizing political violence and harassment against women in 2012. In 2016 and 2017, global and regional organizations began to raise awareness and take action: the National Democratic Institute (NDI) launched the #NotTheCost campaign to stop violence against women in politics; the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) undertook a global study of sexism, violence, and harassment against female members of parliament (MPs); and the Inter-American Commission of Women published a model law to combat violence against women in political life. In 2018, the #MeToo movement led to the suspension or resignation of male MPs and cabinet ministers in North America, Western Europe, and beyond. Available statistics indicate that violence against women in politics is not uncommon. The IPU finds that, globally, nearly all female MPs have experienced psychological violence in the course of their parliamentary work. Approximately one-third have suffered economic violence, one-quarter some type of physical violence, and one-fifth some form of sexual violence (Inter-Parliamentary Union 2016, 3). These patterns are confirmed at country and local levels. Of 425 women who ran for office in Malawi in 2009, 225 quit before the elections were over because of harassment and intimidation (Semu-Banda Reference Semu-Banda 2008). In Afghanistan, nearly all female candidates interviewed in the 2010 elections had received threatening phone calls (National Democratic Institute 2010). In Peru, 41% of female mayors and local councilors had been subjected to violence (Quintanilla Reference Quintanilla 2012). In Bolivia, 70% of women had been victims of violence more than once (Rojas Valverde Reference Rojas and Eugenia 2012). Despite emerging global attention, several conceptual ambiguities remain regarding the contours of this phenomenon. First, definitions used by NDI and the IPU focus on women, suggesting that these acts target women because of their gender—but without comparing their experiences to those of men (Krook Reference Krook 2017). Second, terminology varies. UN Women and the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) highlight violence against women in elections, rather than in political life, whereas debates in Latin America distinguish between political violence and harassment. Finally, sources diverge in recognizing different forms of violence: the Bolivian law names two, IFES identifies three, and the IPU lists four. This article seeks to resolve these ambiguities to lay the foundations for improved global research and programming. To make the concept of “violence against women in politics” more theoretically, empirically, and methodologically robust, we draw on literatures in multiple disciplines, a large collection of new stories and practitioner reports, and interviews we conducted in Asia, Latin America, North Africa, Western Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa between 2014 and 2018. In the first section, we propose that the presence of bias against women in political roles distinguishes this phenomenon from political violence and violence against politicians. We argue that violence against women in politics originates in structural violence, is carried out through cultural violence, and results in symbolic violence against women. The second section maps empirical manifestations, emphasizing continuities across a broad range of behaviors falling under the umbrella of violence against women in politics. Recognizing that definitions of violence are contested, however, we introduce a distinction between violence, the use or threat of use of force, and harassment, the creation of a hostile work environment. We combine research and practitioner work on political violence and violence against women to identify four types: physical, psychological, sexual, and economic. Based on trends in women’s experiences emerging in our news and interview data, we theorize one additional form: semiotic. The third section addresses methodological challenges in studying this phenomenon: the problem of underreporting, the value of comparing men’s and women’s experiences, and the need to take intersectionality into account. Seeking to resolve these issues, the fourth section considers how to identify cases of violence against women in politics. Inspired by the literature on hate crimes, we present six criteria to help ascertain whether an attack was potentially motivated by bias. To illustrate how these elements might inform empirical analysis, the fifth section applies our framework to three cases: the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, and the murder of Jo Cox. These acts targeted female politicians performing their political roles and as such ultimately violated their political rights. Based on our framework, we determine that the Rousseff and Cox cases constitute examples of violence against women in politics, but the Bhutto case does not. Ambiguities in the Cox data, in particular, show why a bias event approach is crucial for judging the broader significance of a given case. The final section outlines the negative implications of violence against women in politics and discusses emerging solutions around the globe. Theorizing the Phenomenon Political scientists have long been troubled by political violence, defining it as the use of force— or threatened use of force—to achieve political ends (Della Porta Reference Della Porta 1995). It poses a challenge to democracy when one side gets “its way through fear of injury or death,” rather than “through a process in which individuals or groups recognize each other… as rational interlocutors” (Schwarzmantel Reference Schwarzmantel 2010, 222). Recent studies on violence against politicians and on violence against women in politics extend this agenda to consider threats and intimidation toward those who run for and hold political office. Similar to existing work on political violence, these literatures show how violent tactics seek to distort the collective will, with added impact when they specifically target members of particular groups. Violence against Politicians Violence against politicians has captured the attention of both practitioners and scholars working across disciplines. The IPU Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians recently renewed its efforts to pressure governments to investigate murders and disappearances and achieve redress for MPs unduly excluded from their mandates (Inter-Parliamentary Union 2018). Governments have also taken a keener interest in this issue. In 2015, the Italian parliament commissioned a survey of murdered politicians. In 2017, British prime minister Theresa May called for a review of abuse and intimidation of candidates, and the Swedish government launched a plan to tackle threats and hate directed at officeholders. Most academic research on this topic has been conducted by forensic psychiatrists studying “aggressive/intrusive” behaviors toward public figures, including physical attacks, threats, stalking, property damage, and inappropriate communications. Between 80% and 90% of MPs in New Zealand and the UK report experiencing at least one of these forms of harassment (Every-Palmer, Barry-Walsh, and Pathé Reference Every-Palmer, Barry-Walsh and Pathé 2015; James et al. Reference James, Farnham, Sukhwal, Jones, Carlisle and Henley 2016). More than one-quarter of Canadian politicians described these intrusions as “frightening” or “terrifying” (Adams et al. Reference Adams, Hazelwood, Pitre, Bedard and Landry 2009, 807), and more than 40% of British MPs increased their security measures at home and work as a result (James et al. Reference James, Farnham, Sukhwal, Jones, Carlisle and Henley 2016, 186). For these scholars, intrusive behaviors “stand apart from what might be seen as the MP’s working role” when they “interfere with his or her function, or cross the border into what is perceived as threatening” (178). Political scientists and economists have taken a different approach, seeking to explain when, why, and how groups use violence against politicians—and with what effects. Evidence from Italy indicates that violence is most likely to occur after elections to influence policy, rather than being committed before elections to affect electoral outcomes. It is usually directed at local politicians and most often takes the form of arson and threatening letters (Daniele and Dipoppa Reference Daniele and Dipoppa 2017). Its aim is generally to provoke their removal or render them less effective in pursuing agendas that the group dislikes (Dal Bó, Dal Bó, and Di Tella 2003). Country factors may facilitate such violence; for example, in Mexico the number of narco-assassinations has increased since 2005 as a result of growing criminal fragmentation and political pluralization (Blume Reference Blume 2017). Gender features in only a marginal way in these literatures, despite observations in passing that the majority of perpetrators are male (James et al. Reference James, Farnham, Sukhwal, Jones, Carlisle and Henley 2016) and that murdered politicians also tend to be male (Daniele Reference Daniele 2017). Yet incorporating a gender lens into the study of violence against politicians does more than just highlight the gendered identities of victims and perpetrators. It also points to a related but distinct phenomenon, whereby the origins, means, and effects of violent acts specifically aim to exclude women from the political sphere, disrupting the political process as a means of reinforcing gendered hierarchies. Violence against Women in Politics In September 2017, British MPs held a debate on the abuse and intimidation of political candidates, agreeing that the problem affected all parties and posed a serious problem for democracy. Yet, numerous interventions in the debate by both male and female MPs noted that women were often specifically targeted. Work on online abuse makes a similar observation: whereas “generic trolls” aim to annoy, upset, or anger people, “gender trolls” engage in harassing and threatening behaviors—often using graphic sexualized and gender-based insults—to inspire fear and drive women to withdraw from online discourse (Mantilla Reference Mantilla 2015). Although the technology is new, maligning a woman’s character, often by reference to her sexuality, has been a recurring strategy historically to discredit women’s ideas and inhibit their participation in traditionally male-dominated spaces (Spender Reference Spender 1982). Violence against women in politics thus entails violations of both electoral and personal integrity (Bjarnegård Reference Bjarnegård 2018). It stems from misogyny, a system that polices and enforces patriarchal norms and expectations. Misogyny distinguishes between “good” and “bad” women, punishing the latter for perceived violations of appropriate gender roles (Manne Reference Manne 2018). Political scientists have largely overlooked this phenomenon because they tend to define violence in a minimalistic way, as an act of force. Sociologists and many feminist theorists, in contrast, tend to define violence more comprehensively as an act of violation (Bufacchi Reference Bufacchi 2005), thereby uncovering behaviors that otherwise remain hidden or “naturalized.” Inspired by this work, we propose that violence against women in politics originates in structural violence, is perpetrated through cultural violence, and results in symbolic violence against women (Figure 1). Violence against women in politics begins with structural violence, involving the stratification of access to basic human needs based on ascriptive group membership. Built into the social structure, this stratification enacts harm in the form of unequal life chances (Galtung Reference Galtung 1969), “leav[ing] marks not only on the human body but also on the mind and the spirit” (Galtung Reference Galtung 1990, 294). The structural origins of women’s political exclusion stem from ancient and modern political theories associating men with the public sphere and women with the private (Okin Reference Okin 1979). This divide limits women’s mobility even in countries where women’s movement in public spaces is not legally restricted. Structural violence inspires and rationalizes hostility against women leaders stemming from their perceived status violations (Eagly and Karau Reference Eagly and Karau 2002). Cultural violence provides the means for perpetrating violence against women in politics. It refers to cultural norms used to justify mistreatment, thereby “changing the moral color of an act from red/wrong to green/right or at least to yellow/acceptable” (Galtung Reference Galtung 1990, 291). Rooted in dynamics of structural violence, cultural violence creates a double standard by tolerating violence when perpetrated against members of particular groups. Rape myths are one form: blaming survivors, they suggest that rapes are provoked by women’s personal choices in clothing and behavior (Suarez and Gadalla Reference Suarez and Gadalla 2010). Sexist jokes are another form of cultural violence, expressing antagonistic attitudes toward women under the guise of “benign amusement” (Ford Reference Ford 2000). Sexual objectification is a third common vehicle, reducing women to physical attributes and thereby denying their competence and full emotional and moral capacity (Heflick and Goldenberg Reference Heflick and Goldenberg 2011). Symbolic violence is the intended outcome of violence against women in politics. According to Bourdieu ( Reference Bourdieu 2001), masculine domination is the quintessential form of symbolic violence, seeking to put women who deviate from prescribed norms back “in their place.” What makes symbolic violence so powerful is “misrecognition,” whereby the “dominated apply categories constructed from the point of view of the dominant to the relations of domination” (35). These dynamics can be seen in cases of sex-based harassment: men and women alike may punish individuals who deviate from gender norms to defend their own status in the existing system of gender hierarchy (Berdahl Reference Berdahl 2007). Backlash against agentic women maintains stereotypes and rewards perpetrators psychologically, increasing their self-esteem (Rudman and Fairchild Reference Rudman and Fairchild. 2004). Mapping Empirical Manifestations A minimalist conception of violence as force focuses on the deliberate infliction of physical injury, highlighting the intentions of agents who commit acts of violence at single moments in time. In contrast, a more comprehensive view of violence as violation recognizes a wider range of transgressions, privileging the experiences of victims and the temporally indeterminate “ripples of violence” affecting survivors, their families, and society (Bufacchi Reference Bufacchi 2005; Bufacchi and Gilson Reference Bufacchi and Gilson 2016). Reflecting the latter approach, research and activism on violence against women go beyond physical violence to emphasize a continuum of violent behaviors (Kelly Reference Kelly 1988). International and national frameworks thus enumerate various forms of violence against women. Article 2 of the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women names physical, sexual, and psychological violence, to which Article 3 of the 2011 Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention adds economic violence. World Bank data from 189 countries indicate that all four forms appear in national laws, with varying degrees of recognition: physical violence is criminalized in 137 states, psychological violence in 134, sexual violence in 106, and economic violence in 86 (World Bank 2016). We propose two modifications to these prevailing frameworks. First, recognizing that political scientists without a foundation in gender studies may hesitate to adopt a broad concept of violence, we propose retaining the umbrella concept of violence against women in politics, under which we can distinguish between acts of violence, involving the use of force, and harassment, actions creating a hostile work environment. Second, we theorize a fifth form of violence against women in politics, semiotic violence, which captures dynamics not reducible to the four other types. Figure 2 illustrates how the five types of violence form part of the same field of behaviors, but may nonetheless be distinguished from one another. Physical Violence and Harassment Physical violence involves efforts to inflict bodily harm and injury. In 2004, a Mexican mayoral candidate, Guadalupe Ávila Salinas, was shot dead in broad daylight by the sitting mayor while holding a meeting with women from the community (Jarquín Edgar Reference Jarquín Edgar 2004). Other women have been kidnapped, such as Afghan MP Fariba Ahmadi Kakar, who was abducted by Taliban rebels in 2013 (Graham-Harrison Reference Graham-Harrison 2013), or severely beaten, as was Kenyan parliamentary candidate Flora Terah in 2007 (Terah Reference Terah 2008). Physical harassment entails touching, jostling, or other forms of unwelcome physical proximity, as experienced by an activist in Uganda who was stripped naked by police at a party rally in 2015. It might also involve involuntary confinement; for example, a candidate in Tunisia was locked in her home by her husband to prevent her from attending a campaign event. Footnote 1 The tangible nature of physical acts makes them the most widely recognized and least contested forms of violence against women. They tend to be relatively rare, however, with perpetrators opting for “less costly” means of violence and harassment before escalating to physical attacks. Psychological Violence and Harassment Psychological violence inflicts trauma on individuals’ mental state or emotional well-being. Examples include death and rape threats, carried out in person or online. Laura Boldrini, speaker of the Italian parliament, received bullets in the mail, saw “Death to Boldrini” scrawled on city walls, and was burned in effigy (Feder, Nardelli, and De Luca Reference Feder, Nardelli and De Luca 2018). Rape threats against British MP Jess Phillips on Twitter became so common that she was forced to block her Twitter accounts and report the abuse to police. Footnote 2 Psychological harassment occurs inside and outside of official political settings. Malalai Joya, an Afghan MP, was called a prostitute and had water bottles thrown at her in parliament; in 2007 she was ejected by a show of hands, in violation of official procedures for suspending an MP (EqualityNow 2007). Ayaka Shiomura, a Japanese local councilor, was taunted by male colleagues, who yelled “Go and get married” and “Can’t you give birth?” at her while she was making a speech on increasing the number of women in the workforce (Lies Reference Lies 2014). In Sierra Leone, men in secret societies have sought to scare off female candidates (Kellow Reference Kellow 2010). Sexual Violence and Harassment Sexual violence comprises sexual acts and attempts at sexual acts by coercion. Stigma prevents many women from coming forward to report their experience of sexual violence. For example, it was only in 2014, during debates on sexual violence in Canadian politics, that former deputy prime minister Sheila Copps disclosed she had been sexually assaulted by a male provincial parliament colleague in 1980 (CBS News 2014). In 2016, Monique Pelletier revealed she was assaulted by a male senator in 1979 while serving as the French minister of women’s rights. Footnote 3 Sexual harassment entails unwelcome sexual comments or advances. In recent years, elected men who have lost their positions because of such allegations include Mbulelo Goniwe, chief whip for the African National Congress party in South Africa in 2006; Massimo Pacetti and Scott Andrews, Liberal MPs in Canada in 2014; Silvan Shalom, interior minister of Israel in 2015; and Denis Baupin, vice president of the French National Assembly in 2016 (Krook Reference Krook 2018b). The rise of the #MeToo movement in 2017 has accelerated similar disclosures in countries as diverse as Britain, Canada, Korea, Russia, and the United States. Economic Violence and Harassment Feminists theorize economic violence as abuse seeking to deny or control women’s access to financial resources (UN Women/UNDP 2017, 17), whereas definitions of electoral violence include injuries inflicted on “person or property at any stage of the long electoral cycle” (Norris, Frank, and Martínez i Coma Reference Norris, Frank and i Coma 2014, 9). We define economic violence as property damage, ranging from petty vandalism to attempts to undermine a woman’s economic livelihood. Extremists defaced and tore down women’s campaign posters in Iraq (Abdul-Hassan and Salaheddin Reference Abdul-Hassan and Salaheddin 2018), and British MP Angela Eagle had a brick thrown through the window of her constituency office (Perraudin Reference Perraudin 2016). In India, the land and crops of a local councilor were destroyed (Asian Human Rights Commission 2006). Economic harassment involves withholding economic resources to reduce women’s capacity to perform their political responsibilities. In Bolivia, local officials refused to pay the salaries of elected women (Corz Reference Corz 2012), and in Peru, the husband of a local councilor prevented her from having access to the family’s money after she was elected (Quintanilla Reference Quintanilla 2012). In Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, and Peru, locally elected women, but not their male colleagues, were denied offices, telephones, and even travel expenses (Krook and Restrepo Sanín Reference Krook and Restrepo Sanin 2016). Semiotic Violence and Harassment Semiotic violence is perpetrated through degrading images and sexist language (Krook Reference Krook 2019). Sexual objectification is one strategy of semiotic violence. After the election of Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović in 2015, national news outlets published stills from an alleged sex tape of her; in 2016, photos supposedly of her wearing a bikini went viral (“OK Ladies” 2016). Symbolic annihilation is another strategy. This concept, which was developed in media studies, proposes that excluding or trivializing particular groups transmits a message about the societal value of the members of those groups (Klein and Shiffman Reference Klein and Shiffman 2009). Symbolic annihilation occurs in politics in at least two ways. First, opponents seek to erase women as actors in the political imagination. In 2009, ultra-Orthodox newspapers in Israel altered photos of the cabinet to exclude its female members (Huffington Post Reference Huffington Post 2009). Second, rules of language and grammar are deployed to resist gendered transformations. In 2014, a conservative male MP in France repeatedly addressed the president of the National Assembly as Madame le Président (using the masculine form of “president”), despite her telling him multiple times to use Madame la Présidente, the feminine form (Cotteret Reference Cotteret 2014). A third strategy is to employ highly negative gendered language to characterize female politicians and their behaviors. Misogynistic merchandise featuring slogans like “Trump That Bitch!” was widely sold at Donald Trump rallies during the 2016 U.S. presidential elections (Bellstrom Reference Bellstrom 2016), and Trump famously called Hillary Clinton “a nasty woman” during the final presidential debate. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte described Senator Leila de Lima as “immoral” and an “adulterer” when she challenged his leadership, actions that female colleagues condemned as “slut-shaming” (Sherwell Reference Sherwell 2016). Interrelated Violence Analytically distinguishing between these five types does not mean that they are clearly distinct in practice. Sexual assault, for example, may have both physical and psychological components. Similarly, when distributed to a larger public, photoshopped images constitute semiotic violence; when sent to the woman in question, they entail psychological and sexual harassment. These overlaps do not undermine our classification, we argue, but rather bolster the case for thinking about these acts as part of a shared field of practices. Interrelations are perhaps best illustrated, however, by cases where different forms of violence appear in an escalating pattern over time. For Juana Quispe, a local councilor in Bolivia, psychological and economic harassment culminated in physical violence. Even though Quispe and her male party colleagues were critical of the mayor, she was singled out for mistreatment. The mayor, his supporters, and various local councilors first pressured her to resign. When she did not do so, they changed the council’s meeting times and refused her entrance to the sessions. They then falsely accused her of corruption, suspending her from her position. She waged a seven-month legal battle that resulted in her being reinstated, but the council then denied her a salary for those seven months, arguing that she had not attended its sessions. One month later, she was murdered (Corz Reference Corz 2012). Footnote 4 Tackling Methodological Challenges Documenting violence against women is notoriously difficult. Many women are reluctant to report violence because of feelings of shame and stigma, fear of retaliation, and perceived impunity for perpetrators (Palermo, Bleck, and Peterman 2014). Normalized in many societies, violence against women is rarely seen as a problem in need of intervention. In the case of violence against women in politics, political dynamics further disincentivize speaking out. Additionally, calls to incorporate gender and intersectionality raise questions about the robustness of research if men are not included as subjects and how diversity among women should be recognized and taken into account. Reporting Instances of Violence Perhaps the number one barrier to studying this phenomenon is the tendency to dismiss violence as “the cost of doing politics.” While some of this resistance appears to stem from a hesitance to be viewed as “victims,” many elected women acknowledge that female colleagues have been targeted for gender-based violence (Cerva Cerna Reference Cerva Cerna 2014). Footnote 5 A best practice strategy for collecting statistics on violence against women is to avoid the word “violence,” giving rise to varied subjective interpretations, in favor of asking a list of questions about specific acts (United Nations 2014). Using this approach, the IPU (2016) finds that violence and harassment against women parliamentarians is widespread. Silence on these issues is not merely a cognitive question, however. It may also be a strategic decision. In interviews, women admit frankly that speaking out would be a form of “political suicide.” Footnote 6 One reason is that most perpetrators are members of the woman’s own political party (National Democratic Institute 2018; UN Women 2014). Insiders may justify suppressing women’s accounts out of concerns about negative publicity that could be exploited at election time. Another concern is that women may believe that it will reflect badly on themselves, as in Tanzania where demanding sexual favors for political positions is widespread. Footnote 7 Silence may also be the result of staff decisions to read and delete abusive correspondence, so that MPs are not fully aware of the extent of harassment (Committee on Standards in Public Life 2017). In cases where women are willing to speak out, moreover, it is rarely clear to whom they should report. In 2014, sexual harassment allegations against Canadian MPs from different parties led to the discovery that there were no procedures in place to handle such claims. Footnote 8 In the wake of the #MeToo movement, women in several countries have created anonymous reporting mechanisms to fill this gap. Footnote 9 In Mexico, where the problem is well recognized but no legal framework yet exists, women have lodged complaints with diverse state institutions. Footnote 10 Opening up about sexual violence or harassment may backfire, however, causing female politicians to be portrayed as overly emotional, as occurred after Australian prime minister Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech in parliament in 2012 (Wright and Holland Reference Wright and Holland. 2014). Women may also simply not be believed: when Kim Weaver stood down as a candidate in an Iowa congressional race against incumbent Steve King, citing “very alarming acts of intimidation, including death threats,” he tweeted in response, “Death threats likely didn’t happen but a fabrication” (Fang Reference Fang 2017). Comparing Men’s and Women’s Experiences A second challenge in studying this topic stems from calls to take “gender” seriously in political research. Some scholars argue that it is vital to study men and women together, recognizing that men are gendered beings and that comparison is essential for ascertaining whether or not gender plays a role (Bjarnegård Reference Bjarnegård 2018). Bolstering the case for this approach, a review by IFES of its electoral violence data finds that men are more often victims of physical violence, whereas women are more likely to face psychological violence (Bardall Reference Bardall 2011). Some male politicians have also been targeted for gender-based attacks: Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States, was assassinated in 1978 by an antigay colleague. Emphasizing that men also experience gender-based political violence, however, risks theorizing a false symmetry between men’s and women’s experiences. Within the broader field of violence against women, emphasis on the fact that most victims of gender-based violence are women gave rise to a counternarrative—based not on facts but driven by broader political agendas—claiming that men and women were equally victims and perpetrators of domestic violence. This equivalence perspective, however, is easily disproved when types and severity of violence are taken into account (Berns Reference Berns 2001). In the political world, some male politicians do claim to be equally or more abused than their female counterparts. Footnote 11 Yet many male MPs reject the notion of equivalence; for example, British MP Martin Whitfield stated, “I fully accept that my experience… is but a mere toe in the water compared with the vile abuse received by other…Members, especially women.” Footnote 12 Focusing on mere numbers also can distort perceptions of gender and political violence. A study of mafia assassinations of Italian mayors observes that all victims were male, without noting that women are severely underrepresented in these positions. Taking Intersectionality into Account The emphasis on violence against women in politics, finally, seems to suggest that gender is the only source of abuse. However, the concept of intersectionality theorizes that different facets of identity interact to shape life opportunities and experiences (McCall Reference McCall 2005). Although intersectionality has not yet been incorporated widely into theorizing about violence against women in politics (Kuperberg Reference Kuperberg 2018), it is present in news coverage and emerging data on this phenomenon. An analysis of Twitter abuse against female MPs in the United Kingdom finds that nearly half of the abusive tweets were directed at Diane Abbott, the first black woman to be elected to the British parliament; when Abbott was taken out of the sample, black and Asian women still received 30% more abuse than their white counterparts (Amnesty International UK 2017). These interactions are not limited to gender and race. In the United Kingdom, sexism combined with anti-Semitism against Luciana Berger, a Jewish MP, and homophobic slurs were made against Angela Eagle, the first openly lesbian MP. Footnote 13 Poor and lower-caste women are more vulnerable than other groups in India, Nepal, and Pakistan (UN Women 2014, 64-65), whereas younger women are more prone to violence and harassment according to global data from the IPU (2016). Women who challenge gender roles in multiple ways—being outspoken feminists Footnote 14 or ascending to prominent leadership positions (Davies Reference Davies 2014)—also seem to experience more numerous and more vitriolic attacks. The intersectional nature of this violence, however, does not undermine bias against women as a key driver. Rather, it substantiates the intuition that structural, cultural, and symbolic violence against women and members of other marginalized groups lie at the heart of this phenomenon. Identifying Bias Events Due to dynamics of structural, cultural, and symbolic violence, bias against particular groups is often highly naturalized. As a result, perpetrators may not be aware of their prejudice, and targets may accept mistreatment as simply the normal course of affairs. This creates serious challenges to identifying acts of violence against women in politics. To move beyond this impasse, we draw on the hate crimes literature to conceptualize violence against women in politics as “bias events.” Translating this into a strategy for empirical research, we pull from existing legal guidance to create six indicators for identifying cases of violence against women in politics. Consistent with legal applications, this holistic approach does not require that all six criteria be met. Rather, it calls for pieces of evidence to be weighed in relation to one another to determine whether, on balance, they would support a finding of bias against women in political roles. The Concept of Hate Crimes Hate crime laws impose a higher class of penalties when a violent crime targets victims because of their perceived social group membership. These crimes are deemed to be more severe because they also involve group-based discrimination. Used to reassert privilege on the part of dominant groups, their impact “goes far beyond physical or financial damages. It reaches into the community to create fear, hostility, and suspicion” (Perry Reference Perry 2001, 10). These “message crimes” thus aim to deny equal rights to group members and heighten a sense of vulnerability among other members of the community (Iganski Reference Iganski 2001). One critique of hate crime legislation is that it punishes “improper thinking,” violating the right to free speech (Jacobs and Potter Reference Jacobs and Potter 1997). Yet the aim of these laws is to ensure that all members of society are free to exercise their civil rights without public or private interference (Weisburd and Levin Reference Weisburd and Levin 1994). Perpetrators’ actions seek to diminish free speech on the part of the harassed and other members of their group (Mantilla Reference Mantilla 2015). Women have not fully benefited from existing hate crime laws because of the frequent exclusion of gender as a category (McPhail Reference McPhail 2002). This stems not only from structural and cultural violence naturalizing the mistreatment of women but also from the existence of other laws on violence against women (Walters and Tumath Reference Walters and Tumath 2014). A further challenge relates to the word “hate,” given that perpetrators rarely, in fact, hate all women. Manne critiques this “naïve conception” of misogyny in favor of thinking about it as a property of social systems, in which women face hostility “because they are women in a man’s world” (2018, 33; emphasis in original). Weisburd and Levin advocate using the term “bias crime,” arguing that it more accurately captures this discriminatory, group-based hierarchical component. As civil rights violations, the hateful intent of the perpetrator is less important than the discriminatory use of violence against those who are seen as “transgressors” against their “proper role” in society (1994, 36). Focusing only on “crimes,” we argue, is also too limited. We expand our focus, therefore, to include what police in England and Wales label “hate incidents” or “any non-crime perceived by the victim or any other person, as being motivated by prejudice or hate” (Ask the Police 2018). With these modifications, we propose the umbrella concept of “bias events” as the broader category drawing lines around what does and does not constitute an act of violence against women in politics. A bias event approach has numerous advantages over a hate crime framework for analyzing violence against women in politics. First, it avoids unduly restricting the focus to criminal behaviors, recognizing that legal standards vary across countries, as does state capacity to enforce laws. Second, this approach decenters the state and the police as the only actors relevant to tackling violence against women in politics, opening up opportunities for other actors, such as international organizations, political parties, and civil society, to be active on this issue. Third, it displaces a focus on perpetrator intentions, which can be misunderstood or denied, in favor of the perspectives and experiences of victims and society at large. Criteria for Ascertaining Bias To develop criteria for identifying bias events, we start with the guidelines in the FBI’s Hate Crime Data Collection Guidelines and Training Manual. The FBI notes that because it is difficult to ascertain an offender’s subjective motivation, a crime should be deemed to be motivated by bias “only if investigation reveals sufficient objective facts to lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the offender’s actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by bias” (2015, 4). These guidelines list various types of evidence that—particularly when combined—might support a finding of bias. We focus on five of these, fleshing out how they might be used to analyze potential acts of violence against women in politics and establish the presence of bias against women in political roles (see Table 1). First, the offender made oral comments, written statements, or gestures indicating bias. This might include using sexist or sexualized language—in-person, in print, or online—objectifying or otherwise denigrating women. Second, the offender left bias-related drawings, symbols, or graffiti at the scene. Perpetrators, in this case, might post degrading images of female politicians, or paint sexist insults on campaign posters, homes, or constituency offices. Third, the victim was engaged in activities related to his or her identity group. Political women in this scenario might be outspoken feminists, but they may also simply have sought to speak up for women. Fourth, the offender was previously involved in a similar incident or is a hate group member. The perpetrator might have harassed other female politicians, or might participate in men’s rights networks or other groups seeking to defend patriarchy. Fifth, a substantial portion of the community where the event occurred perceived that the incident was motivated by bias. Footnote 15 Evidence for this might include speeches, opinion pieces, or demonstrations —especially by other women—which explicitly attribute the attack to a woman’s gender. Not all acts of bias are so transparent, however. In cases of unconscious bias, people believe that they are not prejudiced, but nonetheless think or act in biased ways. Unconscious bias may appear in the form of microaggressions: everyday indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative views toward members of certain groups (Sue Reference Sue 2010). A more purposive approach masks prejudiced views by claiming other forms of wrongdoing, for example through “judicial harassment,” whereby individuals are targeted with baseless legal charges that divert time, energy, and resources away from their work (Frontline Defenders 2018). To detect these forms of bias, we propose a final criterion: the victim was evaluated negatively according a double standard. This might include attacking female politicians in ways and for reasons not used for male politicians. This hate-crimes-inspired approach goes far in resolving the three methodological challenges described earlier. First, the analysis does not require that the perpetrator or victim recognize the act as an instance of violence against women in politics. Second, this approach is case based and thus does not require comparisons with other populations to establish that sexism and misogyny played a role. Third, attention to bias as a larger category enables intersectional experiences to be taken into account, while also presenting a framework for ascertaining bias against members of other marginalized groups. By emphasizing the need for analysis, finally, this approach opens up the possibility that some incidents against female politicians may not be attributable to bias. Applying the Framework According to a bias event approach, ascertaining the meaning of particular acts requires placing them in their broader context, using information about their content, targets, perpetrators, and impact. Consistent with the FBI handbook, this approach does not require that all six criteria be met in full. Recognizing that many cases will be ambiguous, with potentially conflicting or competing sources of information, our framework uses these criteria as guidance to explore whether, on balance, the available data would support a finding of bias. Illustrating how to gather and weigh evidence through this lens, we analyze three cases from different parts of the world to determine whether – or not – they constitute violence against women in politics. Benazir Bhutto Benazir Bhutto served as prime minister of Pakistan from 1988 to 1990 and 1993 to 1996. After years living abroad, she returned in October 2007 to contest parliamentary elections. Upon her homecoming, she survived an assassination attempt when her motorcade was bombed on its way to a campaign rally in Karachi, killing hundreds of bystanders. On December 27, after months of a tense political and security situation, she was killed as she stood up in her car, waving from the open sunroof, while leaving a rally at Liaquat Bagh park in Rawalpindi. The next day, the Ministry of the Interior announced the cause of death and identified who was responsible for the attack. This quick resolution raised more questions than it answered. In 2008, her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, the new Pakistani president, requested support from the UN for a fact-finding mission to establish the circumstances surrounding her assassination. Conducting more than 250 interviews over the course of nine months, the UN team noted the lack of data available for evaluation: the crime scene was hosed down within an hour of the attack, only 23 pieces of evidence were collected, and an autopsy on the body was not permitted. The team ultimately concluded that these failures were deliberate (United Nations Committee of Inquiry 2010). After the initial arrests, police abandoned their efforts to identify the suicide bomber, leaving his motives unclear. As a result, there is no evidence regarding (1) comments, statements, or gestures and (2) drawings, symbols, and graffiti that might support a finding of gender bias. Evidence that is available, however, strongly points to political motivations for the attack: Bhutto was placed under house arrest before the assassination, there were curious security lapses on the day of her assassination, and government officials behaved suspiciously in the wake of the attacks (Farwell Reference Farwell 2011; Hussain Reference Hussain 2008; United Nations Commission of Inquiry 2010). The longer trajectory of Bhutto’s career, nonetheless, provides ample testimony of hostility to her leadership due to the fact that she was a woman. When she returned to Pakistan in the late 1980s, she was constantly asked in media interviews why she was not married, leading her to consent to an arranged marriage so she could continue her political activities. In 1988, her party won the elections, but religious leaders opposed her leadership, arguing that a woman could not serve as head of an Islamic state (Zakaria Reference Zakaria 1990). Empowerment of women formed a key part of her party’s manifesto, and one of her first actions as prime minister was to free many female prisoners, symbolically releasing women from the “social prisons” they had suffered during the military dictatorship (Weiss Reference Weiss 1990). While this suggests she (3) was engaged in activities related to her identity group, her government subsequently failed to overturn some of the most discriminatory laws against women (Suvorova Reference Suvorova 2015). By 2007, her focus on women’s issues was much reduced, appearing in the second half of her party manifesto in a mere half-page of a 22-page document (Pakistan Peoples Party 2008). Because of the botched police investigation, many theories flourished regarding her assassins and their potential motivations. Government officials attributed the attack to Al-Qaeda. The UN team noted that Bhutto did worry that Al-Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban might seek to harm her because of her strong stance against religious extremism. During her last few months in Pakistan, however, she came to believe that then-president Pervez Musharraf was the main threat to her safety (United Nations Commission of Inquiry 2010). She was also deeply suspicious of the military and intelligence communities, calling out by name three senior Musharraf allies whom she believed were planning to murder her (Farwell Reference Farwell 2011). While she believed that the dangers were real, Bhutto was convinced that threat warnings passed to her by the government were intended to intimidate her to stop campaigning (Muñoz Reference Muñoz 2014). Although Al-Qaeda and the Taliban were (4) previously involved in similar violent incidents, these additional considerations indicate that all potential suspects were driven overwhelmingly by questions of policy and political power. In terms of (5) reactions of the community to the question of gender bias, commentary to this effect was relatively minimal. The Al-Qaeda leader accused of planning the assassination strongly denied assassinating Bhutto, explaining: “Tribal people have their own customs. We certainly don’t strike women” (Lamb Reference Lamb 2010). Similarly, in an otherwise extremely detailed, single-spaced, 65-page report, the UN team devoted only one line to gendered motivations, stating that “Ms. Bhutto’s gender was also an issue with the religious extremists who believed that a woman should not lead an Islamic country” (United Nations Commission of Inquiry 2010, 49). Among the three Musharraf allies identified by Bhutto, only one was explicitly said to “not like women meddling in politics” (Farwell Reference Farwell 2011, 217). Finally, the response of international leaders largely focused on violence as a threat to democracy, with gendered content restricted to noting she was a woman or calling her Ms. Bhutto (Hussain Reference Hussain 2008). Regarding whether Bhutto (6) was punished according to a negative double standard, evidence again points to a lack of gender bias. She was not the first political figure in Pakistan to die in an untimely fashion. Her father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who served as president and as prime minister, was executed in 1979. Even more tellingly, Pakistan’s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, was assassinated in 1951, in the same park Bhutto was leaving as she was killed. When she arrived at the hospital after the October suicide bombing, the staff was busy treating victims of a shooting at a rival candidate’s rally earlier that day. The only discriminatory treatment uncovered by the UN team was a letter in which the Interior Ministry instructed provincial governments to provide stringent and specific security measures for two male ex-prime ministers; no similar directive was issued for Bhutto, also an ex-prime minister. The reason, however, appears to be political: both men were members of the ruling party and close allies of Musharraf (United Nations Commission of Inquiry 2010). Based on this analysis, we conclude that Bhutto’s assassination entailed political violence and violence against politicians, not violence against women in politics. Dilma Rousseff Dilma Rousseff was elected as the first female president of Brazil in 2011 and reelected in 2014. Her reelection was challenged by the main opposition party, and in May 2015, opposition groups presented the party with a petition to impeach Rousseff. Senior leaders did not accept this petition, although they made clear their intention to search for grounds of alleged wrongdoing (Chalhoub et al. Reference Chalhoub, Collins, Llanos, Pachón and Perry 2017). In December 2015, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Cunha, accepted a formal denunciation claiming that Rousseff had committed administrative infractions in the presentation of government accounts and budgeting practices. The Chamber voted in April 2016 to move ahead with impeachment proceedings. Four weeks later, the Senate voted to suspend Rousseff’s powers during the trial, and her vice president, Michel Temer, became the acting president. In August 2016, the Senate removed Rousseff from office, finding her guilty of breaking the budget law. On their face, impeachment proceedings do not appear to constitute a form of “violence,” nor do they seem like a particularly gendered form of attack. A deeper probe into this case, however, reveals patterns consistent with a bias event seeking to violate women’s political rights. Those who promoted the process and voted in favor of impeachment made numerous (1) comments, statements, or gestures indicating bias. Soon after being elected in 2010, Rousseff indicated her preference to be referred to as presidenta (the feminine form). Latin American news outlets overwhelmingly called her presidenta, as did female politicians and members of her own party. In contrast, those voting for impeachment, as well as conservative media outlets, persisted in calling her presidente, the masculine form (Dos Santos Reference Dos Santos 2017). This semiotic violence was accompanied by less gendered but clearly violent language. Deputy Jair Bolsonaro notably dedicated his vote for impeachment to Colonel Carlos Brilhante Ustra, who tortured political prisoners, including Rousseff, during the military dictatorship (Chalhoub et al. Reference Chalhoub, Collins, Llanos, Pachón and Perry 2017). From the time that she first entered the political scene, Rousseff’s appearance—her age, short hair, and professional attire— were seen as an affront to traditional Brazilian standards of femininity (Encarnación Reference Encarnación 2017). Emphasizing these differences, the magazine Veja published an article a day after the Chamber vote, praising Marcela Temer, the 33-year-old wife of the vice president, as “beautiful, maidenlike, and ‘of the home.’” A cover story in Isto É! magazine portrayed Rousseff as hysterical, drawing parallels with Queen Mary I of Portugal and Brazil, known as Maria a Louca (Mary the Crazy; Cardoso and de Souza Reference Cardoso, Gatto, Bellan and de Souza 2016). In July 2015, members of the general public began to place stickers showing Rousseff with her legs spread apart around their gas tank openings, sexually violating her image every time they filled up (Saliba and Santiago Reference Saliba and Santiago 2016). A final set of (2) bias-related drawings and symbols include signs reading Tchau, Querida! (Bye-Bye, Sweetheart!) held up on the Chamber floor by mainly male legislators, taunting Rousseff as they voted for her impeachment. On the day she was inaugurated, Rousseff ( Reference Rousseff 2011) proclaimed, “My greatest commitment, I repeat, is to honoring our women, protecting our most vulnerable people, and governing for everyone.” Actions during her presidency confirm that she (3) was engaged in activities related to her identity group. She continued to advance policies for women implemented under her predecessor and expanded the government’s work to end violence against women and support women’s financial autonomy. She appointed far more women to cabinet positions than previous presidents and elevated the Secretariat on Policies for Women to the status of a full-fledged ministry (Jalalzai and Dos Santos Reference Jalalzai and Dos Santos 2015). After her removal, the interim government moved immediately to reverse these gains. Temer appointed the first all-white, all-male cabinet since the military dictatorship. He collapsed the work of the women’s ministry into the Ministry of Justice, and between 2016 and 2017, he discontinued the majority of policies for women initiated under Rousseff and her predecessor (Rubim and Argolo Reference Rubim and Argolo 2018). The two other main protagonists of impeachment, Cunha and Bolsonaro, are well known for (4) their sexism and misogyny. Cunha sponsored a bill in 2013 to restrict access to abortion in cases of rape and to increase penalties for abortion. In 2015, he criticized the inclusion of “gender ideology” in the national plan of education, seeking to prohibit the use of terms like “gender” and “sexual orientation” in the classroom in favor of emphasizing “natural sexual roles” and the “natural family” (Biroli Reference Biroli 2016). Bolsonaro was described by journalists in 2014 as “the most misogynistic, hateful, elected official in the democratic world” (Greenwald and Fishman Reference Greenwald and Fishman 2014). In response to Congresswoman Maria do Rosário, who denounced the military dictatorship for using sexual violence against dissidents, he took the floor and stated, “I would not rape you. You don’t merit that.” The Supreme Court ruled in her favor when she filed a complaint for libel and slander, which she argued was tantamount to promoting rape culture (Carta Capital Reference Carta Capital 2016). The reaction of women suggests that (5) a substantial portion believed the impeachment was motivated by bias. In an article published in the Guardian in July 2016, one activist wrote, “Almost all feminists agree that her impeachment was sexist and discriminatory,” observing that thousands of women had come together to express solidarity with Rousseff in a “confrontation with the patriarchy, with male chauvinists” (Hao Reference Hao 2016). Female politicians echoed this message. Senator Gleisi Hoffman stated that it was undeniable that misogyny played a role in the impeachment process (Chalhoub et al. Reference Chalhoub, Collins, Llanos, Pachón and Perry 2017), whereas Senator Regina Sousa remarked during the trial, “The message they are sending in this process is also directed at all women. With their blocking actions they are telling us: women cannot” (Amorim Reference Amorim 2016). Rousseff acknowledged this support during her speech in the Senate: “Brazilian women have been, during this time, a fundamental pillar for my resistance.… Tireless companions in a battle in which misogyny and prejudice showed their claws” (Rousseff Reference Rousseff 2016). Finally, ample evidence indicates that Rousseff (6) was punished according to a negative double standard. Her stated offense was using funds from the central bank to conceal a budget deficit before the 2014 elections, which she later reimbursed. This budgetary practice, known in pedaladas fiscais, was made illegal in 2000, but had been employed by two previous presidents without penalty. Moreover, many legal experts agreed that it did not amount to a “crime of responsibility,” the only type of crime that justifies removing an elected president (Encarnación Reference Encarnación 2017). In addition, most governors and many mayors engage in pedaladas, including a former governor who served as the rapporteur for the Senate’s special commission on impeachment. Further, more than 100 of the 513 deputies themselves were under formal investigation for some kind of criminal activity at the time of the impeachment vote, including Cunha (Chalhoub et al. Reference Chalhoub, Collins, Llanos, Pachón and Perry 2017). Corruption probes were eventually ordered against more than one-third of the members of Temer’s cabinet (Democracy Now 2017). Rousseff, in contrast, stands out as one of the cleanest politicians in Brazil (Chalhoub et al. Reference Chalhoub, Collins, Llanos, Pachón and Perry 2017). Together with the other evidence, this leads us to classify her impeachment as an instance of violence against women in politics, with psychological, sexual, and semiotic components. Jo Cox Jo Cox became a member of the British House of Commons in 2015, representing the Labour Party. On June 16, 2016, she was fatally shot and stabbed while arriving at a routine constituency surgery (a weekly walk-in session for constituents to meet with their MPs) in Birstall, West Yorkshire. The last sitting British MP to be killed was Conservative MP Ian Gow, who was assassinated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1990; the last politician to die in an attack was county councilor Andrew Pennington in 2000. Cox’s murder occurred one week before the contested Brexit referendum, in which she was a vocal advocate for Britain to remain in the European Union. She also spoke positively about immigration and campaigned on behalf of refugees from Syria. Witnesses reported that the assailant, Thomas Mair, yelled during the attack, “Britain first, keep Britain independent, Britain will always come first. This is for Britain” (Cobain, Parveen, and Taylor Reference Cobain, Parveen and Taylor 2016). The UK Independence Party leader, Nigel Farage, among other politicians, had made immigration one of the central issues of the Brexit campaign. Adding to these tensions, in May 2016 the extremist Britain First political party pledged that it would target Muslims holding elected office in the United Kingdom, not stopping until all the “Islamist occupiers” were driven out of politics (York Reference York 2016). This context indicates that Mair (1) made comments, statements, or gestures indicating bias. However, the bias in this case appears to be driven by race rather than gender. Mair’s “death to traitors” outburst during his first court appearance further shows that he viewed Cox as betraying her own race through her policy stances. A search of Mair’s house and computer records following the attack uncovered (2) bias-related drawings and symbols. He had books on the Nazis, German military history, and white supremacy. He also kept newspaper clippings about Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 members of the Norwegian Labour Party in 2011. Mair’s internet searches included information on the British National Party, apartheid, the Ku Klux Klan, white supremacy, and Nazism (Cobain, Parveen, and Taylor Reference Cobain, Parveen and Taylor 2016). These clues, again, point to racial prejudice, rather than gender bias, as a motivating factor. In his sentencing, however, the judge did make brief mention of a potential gender element when addressing Mair: “You even researched matricide, knowing that Jo Cox was the mother of young children” (Wilkie Reference Wilkie 2016, 2). Cox herself was (3) was clearly engaged in activities related to her identity group. On Twitter, she had shared a picture of herself and a group of Labour MPs holding up signs saying #Imafeminist. She disclosed to friends that she was concerned about the “increasing nature of hostility and aggression” toward female MPs (Hughes, Riley-Smith, and Swinford Reference Hughes, Riley-Smith and Swinford 2016). She had personally contacted police after receiving a stream of malicious messages over the course of three months, which led to the arrest of a man who was given a warning in connection with his conduct in March 2016. Because of this online harassment, at the time of her death police were considering implementing additional security both at her constituency surgery in Birstall and at her houseboat in London. They found no links between this harasser and Mair, however. Based on the first three criteria of the bias event approach, it thus appears that Cox’s murder is best understood as a case of violence against politicians. Considering the next two criteria shifts the picture somewhat. Mair was (4) a supporter of hate groups who attended gatherings of far-right political groups like the National Front and the English Defence League and purchased publications written by extremist groups in the United States and South Africa. Ideas about white supremacy and male supremacy are inextricably linked, according to prominent antihate organizations (ADL 2018). Within the white male supremacist worldview of “naturalized and hierarchized differences” (Ferber Reference Ferber 1998), elements of misogyny are as integral as racist beliefs, with intense rage being generated by the prospect of a white woman challenging racism (Shaw Reference Shaw 2016). Following the attack, (5) a substantial portion of the community perceived that the incident was motivated by gender bias. Female MPs in particular viewed the murder through a gender lens. Diane Abbott stated, “It is hard to escape the conclusion that the vitriolic misogyny that so many women politicians endure framed the murderous attack on Jo” (Hughes, Riley-Smith, and Swinford Reference Hughes, Riley-Smith and Swinford 2016). Cox’s friend, Jess Phillips, published numerous editorials in the ensuing months, writing at the time of Mair’s sentencing that “for me and for many of my colleagues—particularly female MPs—fear has also become real and present” (Phillips Reference Phillips 2016). These perceptions were echoed by male politicians. Labour MP Chris Bryant, vocal in calling for these threats to be taken more seriously, remarked, “I think women MPs, gay MPs, ethnic minority MPs get the brunt of it” (Mason Reference Mason 2016). These perceptions are borne out by data: while women make up 32% of MPs, the Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team, established after Cox’s murder, estimates that approximately 60% of the cases it received concerned female MPs. Footnote 16 Viewing her murder in terms of challenges to women’s political presence, the Labour Party launched the Jo Cox Women in Leadership Programme. Drawing parallels with suffragettes who “had to contend with open hostility and abuse to win their right to vote,” Prime Minister Theresa May, a Conservative, opted to make her first public statement on a review of abuse and intimidation of candidates on February 6, 2018, the centenary of women’s suffrage (May Reference May 2018). Evidence that (6) the victim was evaluated negatively according a double standard is less clear. The police review of Mair’s internet search history revealed that he had looked at the Wikipedia page of William Hague (Cobain, Parveen, and Taylor Reference Cobain, Parveen and Taylor 2016), a Conservative politician also from Yorkshire who had served as an MP, party leader, and leader of the opposition before being appointed to the House of Lords in 2015. Like Cox, Hague was a supporter of the Remain campaign. The work of the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre (FTAC), which assesses and manages risks from mentally ill individuals who harass, stalk, or threaten public figures, suggests that Mair most likely targeted Cox because she was his local MP. According to FTAC staff, every MP has a group of resentful constituents who channel their frustrations toward their local MP.17 It thus may have been a mere coincidence that Mair’s local MP was a young woman with pro-immigration views. Given this mixed evidence, we find classification of this case to be the most challenging of the three. A bias event approach does not require that all six criteria be met, however: each simply provides potential clues as to the presence and significance of the bias that informs the commission of the event. Weighing each piece of information and how they fit together as a whole, we determine that the discussion in relation to criteria (4) gives new meaning to the evidence considered under criteria (1) and (2), indicating that the racist language and symbols also have an underlying misogynistic component. The reactions mapped under criteria (5) also lend greater substance to the evidence presented under criteria (3), and vice versa, by explaining why female politicians, particularly feminist ones, may experience a heightened sense of vulnerability to violence and harassment. On this basis, we argue that the murder of Jo Cox is a case of violence against women in politics, with physical and psychological elements. Conclusions Violence against women in politics is increasingly recognized around the world as a significant barrier to women’s political participation. This article seeks to strengthen its theoretical, empirical, and methodological foundations, recognizing that shared concepts and language are vital for building a cumulative research agenda. Conceptualizing this phenomenon in terms of structural, cultural, and symbolic violence, moreover, lays bare what is at stake by allowing violence against women in politics to continue. First, accepting abuse as “the cost of doing politics” raises questions about the robustness of democracy. Even without equality concerns, interfering with election campaigns or preventing officials from fulfilling their mandates violates the political rights of candidates as well as voters. Second, tolerating mistreatment due to individuals’ ascriptive characteristics infringes on their human rights, undermining their personal integrity and sense of social value. Third, normalizing women’s exclusion from political participation relegates them to second-class citizenship, threatening principles of gender equality. Acknowledging the varied manifestations of violence against women in politics, in turn, points to the importance of developing multifaceted solutions. Adopting new legislation or revising existing laws is one approach that has been used extensively in Latin America to combat physical, psychological, and economic violence. Providing guidance for electoral observers in detecting and reporting violence against women during elections, especially physical, psychological, and sexual, has been piloted in Africa and Latin America. In North America and Western Europe, parliaments are developing stronger codes of conduct and procedures for reporting sexual harassment. To track and respond to the online abuse of politically active women, social media companies are partnering with civil society organizations to address psychological, sexual, and semiotic violence. The effectiveness of these strategies is not yet known, highlighting the need for further research and the continued development of countermeasures. A crucial first step for academics and practitioners, however, is to begin raising awareness that violence and harassment should not be the cost of women’s engagement in the political sphere."
21,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA08-2019-APSR.txt," Are legislators responsive to the priorities of the public? Research demonstrates a strong correspondence between the issues about which the public cares and the issues addressed by politicians, but conclusive evidence about who leads whom in setting the political agenda has yet to be uncovered. We answer this question with fine-grained temporal analyses of Twitter messages by legislators and the public during the 113th US Congress. After employing an unsupervised method that classifies tweets sent by legislators and citizens into topics, we use vector autoregression models to explore whose priorities more strongly predict the relationship between citizens and politicians. We find that legislators are more likely to follow, than to lead, discussion of public issues, results that hold even after controlling for the agenda-setting effects of the media. We also find, however, that legislators are more likely to be responsive to their supporters than to the general public. "
22,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA09-2019-APSR.txt," This paper presents new causal estimates of incarceration’s effect on voting, using administrative data on criminal sentencing and voter turnout. I use the random case assignment process of a major county court system as a source of exogenous variation in the sentencing of misdemeanor cases. Focusing on misdemeanor defendants allows for generalization to a large population, as such cases are very common. Among first-time misdemeanor defendants, I find evidence that receiving a short jail sentence decreases voting in the next election by several percentage points. Results differ starkly by race. White defendants show no demobilization, while Black defendants show substantial turnout decreases due to jail time. Evidence from pre-arrest voter histories suggest that this difference could be due to racial differences in exposure to arrest. These results paint a picture of large-scale, racially-disparate voter demobilization in the wake of incarceration. "
23,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA1 - 2022 - Revisiting Theory and Method in Language.txt," It is now some decades since the study of “linguistic ideology” was first proposed (Silverstein 1979), and the time is ripe for taking stock. This article considers some developments in this field as it has emerged and, in some respects, become normalized. Yet, normalized can mean backgrounded, taken for granted—perhaps obscuring important theoretical issues and methodological challenges. I revisit what is entailed by “ideology”; the debate between explicit and implicit sources of evidence (and why this binary is itself problematic); issues of ideological multiplicity and dominance; and questions such as: Must ideology be internally consistent? Why turn to semiotics, and should “language ideology” then be re-labeled “semiotic ideology”? Are ideologies big programs, distinct from local metapragmatic activity? I address these questions while making methodological recommendations about research sites, contrasts and boundaries, attention to flows and connections, and a “centerpiece” method for tracing ideological work. An extended example concerning sociolinguistic variation in Maryland illustrates the discussion. It is now some decades since the study of language ideology began to gather momentum in linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, and allied fields. For me, the topic is “bookended”—spanned—by Michael Silverstein's 1979 essay, “Language Structure and Linguistic Ideology,” and the book Susan Gal and I published in 2019, Signs of Difference. So, forty years. While the concept of “ideology” is much older, the focus on language ideology that accelerated since the 1970's is what is relevant here. On that body of work, the time is ripe for taking stock. This paper considers some of the developments in this field as it has emerged and, in some respects, become normalized. Yet, normalized can mean backgrounded, taken for granted, and when that happens it can obscure important theoretical issues and methodological challenges. I offer a personal perspective on these matters and consider where we are now, and where we can go from here. Spoiler alert: this is not a full-fledged review of the literature. Instead, it tracks my own trajectory and some of the works that have influenced it. Before plunging into the theoretical thickets, I will open with an example, and revisit it now and then throughout my discussion. Because this essay is not primarily the report of an empirical study, the example is just to allow me to illustrate some points informally, not to demonstrate anything. It relates to speech varieties in Maryland, that East Coast state that includes the city of Baltimore. That is where I was born, but I have not lived there for many decades.1 Planning a simple start to looking at speech varieties there by glancing at what other people thought -- not language experts particularly -- who had been in Maryland more recently than I had, I asked Google, “What accent(s) are there in Maryland?” Right away several threads came up, plus a Wikipedia entry. Here's the beginning of a 2020 Reddit thread that came up at the beginning of my search and extends into a longer online discussion. I have deleted the contributors' online “handles,” instead representing separate authors by em-dashes: — I am originally from MD but I moved as a teen to NY and some people tell me I have a southern accent and some say a neutral accent. I am from Montgomery County (if that helps). — We don't have one accent. The Shore, Baltimore area, and the west are all pretty distinct regions with narrow geographical borders. — But on that note: “Check oat all that wudder the far-truck is spraying.” — …I do notice if a Marylander does go up north like NY or MA people will pick up on the ""southness"" in your speech no matter how slight. The entries in this thread all continue in the same vein: specifying geographical locations, often at the county level; parodying Maryland speech; and alluding to Southernness, especially if someone goes “up north”. To illustrate these points, here is a longer version of the thread. I've put the bits about Maryland counties and regions in boldface type; the bits about southern speech are underlined; and the parody bits are in italics: — I am originally from MD but I moved as a teen to NY and some people tell me I have a southern accent and some say a neutral accent. I am from Montgomery County (if that helps). — We don't have one accent. The Shore, Baltimore area, and the west are all pretty distinct regions with narrow geographical borders. — But on that note: “Check oat all that wudder the far-truck is spraying.” — …I do notice if a Marylander does go up north like NY or MA people will pick up on the ""southness"" in your speech no matter how slight. — Same here, there's a bit of South here and there, but most of the comments are when I'm talking about technology. Anybody who came in from out of state tells me I pronounce it Dee ness and Gewgle. — I'm a lifelong Annapolis resident with family from all over MD so here's my take: Baltimore, Bal[timore] Co{unty], Carroll, Frederick, Hartford, Cecil and some of Howard and northern A[nne] A[rundel] - Baltimorese (which I think is mostly southern, but influenced by some northern immigrant dialects). South of route 50 and Eastern Shore—average tidewater southern accent with some baltimorese mixed in (plus some waterman style dialects) MoCo and most of HoCo -- generic American/no accent. west of Frederick Appalachian southern mixed with baltimorese and Pittsburgh. [MoCo = Montgomery County, HoCo = Howard County] In Map 1, you can see the counties and the bay that separates the Eastern Shore from the rest. Two other threads I looked at were similar. One of them delved deeply into the history of the American Civil War (1861-65), which pitted North against South. The other thread tilted more negative, with comments like “one of the most annoying things I hear,” and “Oh lord, this is the worst.” Meanwhile, however, the Wikipedia entry was quite different.2 Here is the beginning of the entry, its first two paragraphs. Rather than discussing the state as a whole, it focuses on the city of Baltimore: A Baltimore accent, also known as Baltimorese (sometimes pseudo-phonetically written Bawlmerese, Ballimorese, etc.), commonly refers to an accent that originates among blue-collar residents of South and Southeast Baltimore, Maryland. It is a sub-variety of Mid-Atlantic American English, as is nearby Philadelphia English. At the same time, there is considerable linguistic diversity within Baltimore, which complicates the notion of a singular “Baltimore accent.” According to linguists, the accent and dialect of African American Baltimoreans are different from the “hon” variety that is popularized in the media as being spoken by white blue-collar Baltimoreans. White working-class families who migrated out of Baltimore city along the Maryland route 140 and Maryland Route 26 corridors brought local pronunciations with them… Notice that the entry calls attention to the linguistic variety spoken by African Americans in Baltimore, as compared with a variety associated with white blue-collar speakers. Notice, too, that the entry seems to be informed by academic sociolinguistics, as suggested by the appeal to the authority of “linguists,” and expressions such as “linguistic diversity within Baltimore.” That impression was confirmed for me later in the entry, by mentions of “Canadian raising” and terms like “non-rhotic speech.” It turns out that the original version of this entry was composed by students in Christine Mallinson's sociolinguistics class at the University of Maryland— Baltimore County. What to make of these excerpts? Obviously, their contributors have different backgrounds and reasons for writing. Beyond that, for now— I will return to them later—just observe that they emphasize different things. The internet threads emphasize subregional geography, history, and “southernness”; the Wikipedia entry emphasizes urban class and racial divisions. This is still a very superficial comparison, though. I will come back to it after embarking on a more theoretical discussion of studies of language ideology, which will require us to take several steps back from Maryland “accents” before we can look at them again. For this more theoretical discussion, it is useful to look at some major issues that emerge from the early definitions and foundational statements about “language ideology,” “linguistic ideology,” and “ideology of language.” What seemed to be important initially, and what has become of these issues in the meantime? What was missing, what remains a problem, and what might we understand better now? What can be recommended for future research in this field? To start with, then, some early definitions. In an article for the Annual Review of Anthropology in 1994, Kathryn Woolard and Bambi Schieffelin reviewed works in the field so far. They distinguished among three definitions of “linguistic ideology” (as Michael Silverstein called it) and “language ideology” or “ideology of language,” expressions some other authors have used. The differences among these definitions already point toward some important issues and debates. Silverstein wrote that “ideologies about language, or linguistic ideologies, are any sets of beliefs about language articulated by the users as a rationalization or justification of perceived language structure and use” (1979, 193). Woolard and Schieffelin compared his statement with two others that they found had a “greater social emphasis” (1994, 57): Shirley Heath's definition of “language ideology” as “the self-evident ideas and objectives a group holds concerning roles of language in the social experiences of members as they contribute to the expression of the group” (Heath 1977, 53); and my own contribution, “the cultural system of ideas about social and linguistic relationships, together with their loading of moral and political interests (Irvine 1989, 255).3 Finally, Woolard and Schieffelin added Alan Rumsey's explanation of “linguistic ideology” as “shared bodies of commonsense notions about the nature of language in the world” (Rumsey 1990, 346). Most obviously there is a difference in label, between “linguistic ideology” and “language ideology.” Initially this difference may have mattered. Heath's work treated language ideology as related to the politics of states, institutions, and large-scale interest groups; it is the “a priori language policy,” the twin of other kinds of policy that are more conspicuously political. Silverstein's statement in his 1979 paper, on the other hand, looked to linguistics as a discipline, focusing on linguists' treatment of reference and grammatical structure. But the difference in labeling has evaporated. Many authors have used these labels interchangeably, or at least without trying to distinguish them. There are other differences among these definitions, however. An important one concerns the locus of the ideas at issue. Heath locates “language ideology” in the background, as opposed to explicit statements of policy; in her version language ideology is a cognitive map, consisting of largely unconscious assumptions, not asserted rationalizations. Silverstein's “linguistic ideology,” on the other hand, is in the foreground, articulated by speakers to rationalize or justify their actions. So, his version is conscious and explicit. It is based on speakers' conscious perceptions, as opposed to unconscious or unnoticed structures of language and usage. In the difference between these two definitions, there are important methodological issues at stake. Does one look for ideology in explicit metalinguistic and metapragmatic assertions, or is that precisely the wrong place to look? (Neither Rumsey nor I committed ourselves on that question.) Finally, something that is not obvious in any of these early definitions, although it became important later, is how ideology relates to social positioning and differences in point of view. Difference, at least among the “users” of a language, is not explicitly addressed in any of these definitional statements and might even seem to be excluded—although Paul Kroskrity, noting the importance of ideological multiplicity in a later review of the field, suggested that the definition in Irvine 1989 did incorporate it because of the mention of social relationships and political interests (Kroskrity 2004, 497). “Political interests” does have that implication of multiplicity, while not asserting it overtly. Still, even if difference is not focused on directly in these early statements of what “linguistic/language ideology” is, difference is in some sense implicit in the very term “ideology” itself, as I will explain. But first, why “ideology,” anyway? At the time of these foundational statements, what made the concept of ideology appealing was that it offered a way to link some system of ideas with politics and power. By the late 1980's, linguistic anthropology had developed a strong interest in political economy and power relations (and came close to “Critical Discourse Analysis” in this respect). Yet, “ideology” as a term had some other implications, especially—though not exclusively—the connotation of “false consciousness.” “Ideology,” rather like “accents,” was something other people had. For example, in the Cold War years, “ideology” in this sense was how each side—the capitalist West and the Soviet East—described each other's ideas and programs. Silverstein's 1979 work treated “linguistic ideology” in this way too. The false consciousness he criticized in that paper was the blinkered belief system of those linguists who saw language as nothing but reference-and-predication, shorn of any social indexicality or pragmatic force, and representing a world exterior to language—a world knowable in some absolute sense without considering the language that, the linguists supposed, merely labeled it. In contrast, Silverstein set to work rehabilitating the intellectual reputation of Benjamin Lee Whorf. Still, what does it mean to claim that someone, or some group, has ideas about the world that can be characterized—and dismissed—as false consciousness? Does it imply that we, in contrast, have some special corner on the truth? If so, it should inspire some uneasiness. Many scholars today feel uncomfortable laying claim to absolute truth, even if truth is what we seek. Moreover, as Terry Eagleton (2007) has pointed out, if some view of the world were utterly false, nobody who believed it could survive. There must be some way in which a system of ideas connects with a real world. So, only part of the view can be false. Or the believers must only partly believe it. There is another lesson, too, from the Cold War usages. Beyond its connection with power, the term “ideology” also implies that no matter how totalizing a system of ideas might seem to be—how well it seems to encompass an entire world—it always posits that there is some other set of ideas that differs, or some group of infidels who fail to believe. This implicit contrast with some other set of ideas is in a way the concept's strength, because it entails difference and comparison; but the supposed connection with falsehood is also why the term “ideology” is enduringly problematic. One way to address this matter is to conceive of ideology as partial: a partial view of the world, incomplete because there are other ways of viewing it; but also partial in the sense of (politically) interested, coming from a specifiable subject position with a point of view and projects for social action. This conception of ideology does not make it necessarily evil or delusional. Moreover, if “ideology” is incomplete, positioned, and politically interested, then it offers an alternative to the term “culture,” which may suggest homogeneity and completeness, and does not necessarily entail anything about social position, power, or politics. In fact, one reason I have favored “ideology” as a useful concept is that there's nothing better on these points. Now, let us return for a moment to the Maryland example, which certainly illustrates different points of view on the same (or overlapping) object. One of these perspectives, the Wikipedia one, can marshal technical knowledge of phonetics in aid of its presentation, as it does in a later part of the entry. But to say that the folk descriptions and more casual, naive commentaries, were “false” would itself be misleading. Among other things, it would miss some important things about what language differences the lay-persons notice (such as linguistic traces of “southernness”)—and it would miss what those differences imply to them. The two points of view, academic and folk, may concern the same object (or, partly the same object), but for different reasons. Moving away from Maryland again for a while, let us turn, as linguistic anthropologists did by the 1990's, to the question of how language ideology relates to power and dominance. How does that work? Do more powerful people and less powerful people (to oversimplify the contrast) necessarily differ in ideology, or only in opportunities to achieve their goals? How do ideologized constructs relate to action, practices, and history? Questions about dominance and multiplicity were an important concern for many of the authors who contributed to edited collections on language ideologies that appeared at the end of the 1990s.4 Were some people—the less powerful—totally hoodwinked, blindly accepting principles of language and interaction that worked to their disadvantage? Some scholars thought so, if in less exaggerated terms. For example, in a 1998 volume, Paul Kroskrity argued that the concept of ideology applies best to successfully “naturalized” beliefs and practices that are never publicly challenged and (he maintained) seldom enter members' discursive consciousness. Describing language ideology among Arizona Tewa, Kroskrity showed that ritual speech in the kiva was taken for granted as a prestige model for everyday conduct (Kroskrity 1998, 117). Other contributors to the same 1998 volume, however, presented evidence of counterdiscourses. Jane Hill, writing on Mexicanos (Nahuatl), and Charles Briggs, writing on Warao, each identified contexts in which elite men's discourses were challenged by non-elite men and women (Briggs 1998; Hill 1998). Briggs argued that there is always contestation because it is inherent to how dominance is created (Briggs 1998; Hill 1998). And in the same volume, Susan Gal called attention to instabilities and incoherences in ideologies and in social relations, and to how you conceive of power (Gal 1998). These scholarly disagreements at the end of the 1990s brought to the fore the fundamental methodological issues that were already lurking, I have suggested, in initial definitions of language ideology. To what extent do precepts about language and linguistic practice get manifested in explicit texts and discourse, i.e., metadiscourse? Who articulates them, in what settings, and in what terms? (Silverstein asked these very questions in his commentary to a set of papers in the same 1998 collection; Silverstein 1998.) These problems were already in the air. In 1995, Jef Verschueren had framed them as the relation between explicit and implicit meanings, which combine in various ways. Ideology incorporates both, he proposed (1995, 142), but the implicit ones are harder for researchers to identify. Now if you look at Verschueren's paper you will see that it is more complex and nuanced than this. But many other people have contrasted “explicit” and “implicit” meanings as if they were a simple binary, and this simplification is unhelpful. Does it mean distinguishing (explicit) true/false assertions like “persons X speak in manner Y” from everything else? “Everything else” covers too much ground. It includes such varied possibilities as: the many metapragmatic and metalinguistic terms that occur in all sorts of constructions, not just in True/False assertions; the presuppositions and implicatures that can be tracked in and between utterances; the presence or absence of uptake; and the possible implications of a person's making the assertion at all. These are very different things. To see some of the pitfalls, suppose we tried to apply this binary to the Maryland speech material. In the Reddit thread, authors explicitly identify “accents” with geographical regions and political units (counties within the state), and they discuss “southernness” as an important aspect of speech and other things. I will have more to say about that; but meanwhile, what to do about all the parodies in these threads? (I have provided only a glimpse; the threads have long stretches of parody, represented pseudo-phonetically and sometimes accompanied by a conventionally-spelled version of the same word, just in case the reader mistook parody for ignorance: for example, Merlin vs. Maryland; Bawlmer vs. Baltimore; far vs fire.) Is a parody implicit or explicit? It's double-voiced, of course, to use Bakhtin's term, as reported speech is too. And what to do about the quick move, in another thread, from “southern accents” to grocery stores? There is an implicature that makes this move, which comes right after a comment on “southern accents,” be understood as coherent: The people who told me I had an accent didn’t [seem to me to] have an accent. They could have grown up down the street from me, at least according to my accent-impaired ears. Actually, one was even a Marylander. As for Maryland being a Southern state. It is and it isn’t. But I figure any place where you can regularly find grits6 in the grocery store has to be at least a bit Southern. A simple binary contrast between implicit and explicit discourse will not be enough to account for these things. In real life, or at least in video data, a researcher may also want to consider the raised eyebrow expressing doubt, the head shakes and other gestures, the silences expressing lack of uptake of someone's statement, and so on. All these may be sources of evidence about what people take to be important in communicative acts, how and what they value or dislike or ignore, and what they assume about speakers, activities, and contexts of talk. The relevance of these nonverbal aspects of communication raises questions about whether “ideology of language” should be replaced by some more capacious object of inquiry, such as “semiotic ideology,” a label Webb Keane has proposed (Keane 2003, 2007, and elsewhere). Why “language”, anyway? Obviously, language is what interests those of us who identify as linguistic anthropologists or sociolinguists. And maybe a focus on ideologies about language would be fruitful for investigating ideology about anything else—which might turn out to be about language, too. But our personal preoccupations do not suffice to answer the larger question. For now, my point in raising it is to unsettle a common assumption about language: the assumption that language is a discrete, bounded object. As the gestures that accompany talk attest, language in use is not bounded off from other semiotic modalities. Indeed, to isolate it, to draw a boundary between language and the world of social and material life in which it occurs, is itself an ideological move (whose roots can be traced in European intellectual and religious history). Noting the ideological moves that might be underwriting a concept of “language ideology” as bounded and distinctive, Keane (2003, 2007) suggested that “semiotic ideology” is broader, more neutral, and not tied to that European history. He is certainly right about this. And yet, within a wide semiotic ocean one may still wish to pick out language, or something about language, as a vantage point from which to scan multiple semiotic relationships while retaining some concern for linguistic specificities. Moreover, it is language’s reflexivity—its capacity to refer to itself, among all the other phenomena it so pervasively refers to—that underlies metapragmatics (and other things meta-). This fact, I believe, privileges language for the study of ideology in social life. In our zeal to explore deixis and indexicalities we linguistic anthropologists have sometimes ignored that referential function, sometimes to our analyses’ detriment. I prefer, therefore, to keep linguistic signs at the center of my investigations, while not bounding them off from their myriad connections with other kinds of signs—bodily gestures and postures, clothing, script forms, spatial arrangements, and so on. How to do this without reinscribing the old binary of words and things remains a problem, but it is more a methodological problem than a terminological one. I shall return to these questions. Regardless of labels for our field of inquiry, these considerations about the place of language in semiotics have led many of us to distance ourselves from a Saussurean model of the linguistic sign (as presented in Saussure 1916), in favor of a model from Charles Sanders Peirce, which opens into a broader semiotics (see Peirce 1955). In contrast to the Saussurean model, Peircean semiotics is not limited to linguistic signs, but instead concerns signs of all kinds. For instance, a simple quality (such as redness) can be taken as a sign of something (perhaps ripeness, if it's redness in fruit; or inflammation, if it's redness in bodily tissues). This model allows sign relations to be grounded in a material world. For these reasons a Peircean semiotics unsettles any conception of language that rests on the Saussurean antinomies that locate linguistic sign-relations as mental phenomena, and isolate linguistic signs from any other kinds. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between the two models In a paper we published in 2000, Susan Gal and I delved into the Peircean typology of sign-relations—drawing on more of it than was then usual in our field—in order to combine a Peircean approach with a focus on differentiations, contrasts, and comparisons (Irvine and Gal 2000).7 Notice that this focus on contrasts and comparisons preserves an aspect of Saussure's thought that stands apart from his famous antinomies: his concept of value (see Saussure, 1966, 105). That is, it puts the Peircean sign into conversation with the Saussurean idea about contrastive relations among signs, such that a sign is constituted not only in its own ingredients but also in its relations with other signs—its absent alternatives. Beyond this, however, and certainly beyond Saussure, Gal and I wanted also to attend to processes and action, placing people's sign activity in their social projects and in the contingencies of history, in which we all live.8 I will follow our collaborative work forward now, toward the present. To illustrate the discussion, the extended example of the Maryland speech material remains convenient. First, go back to the Reddit thread and notice some of the many indexicalities and contrasts drawn by contributors there. The pronunciations they discuss index Maryland, of course; that is, they are associated with speakers living in that state, and so can serve as (indexical) signs of those speakers and therefore that state. As I noted earlier, the pronunciations are also taken to index narrower spaces—regions, counties, and cities (Baltimore, Annapolis)—and spaces larger than Maryland, especially the American “South.” That “South,” which the Maryland pronunciation indexes (points to), contrasts with “up north like NY [New York] or MA [Massachusetts]”. But a “southern accent” also contrasts with something termed a “neutral accent”: “Some people tell me I have a southern accent and some say a neutral accent,” writes the Reddit author. In fact, all the parodies and examples of Maryland pronunciation that the Reddit authors offer (or try to offer) by means of spellings that diverge from standard, implicitly contrast with something “neutral” or standard to which these authors also seem to lay claim. Some authors even display scorn for the Maryland version. Here's a particularly strong entry, giving examples of words Marylanders say (these are just the first three in a longer list):9 “Eggs; Many people in Maryland, especially Baltimore, pronounce this word as “aye-gs.” Personally it's one of the most annoying things I hear. Fire: Often sortened [sic; = softened? shortened?] down to “far” with an accent on the A. Beats me why it's so hard to say a 4-letter word. Water; Oh lord, this is the worst. People say “wooder” or sometimes even “wurter.” Yikes.” Although this author's opinion is more extreme than others, all the thread authors take a stance that displays their control of educated spellings, and —even if they are characterizing their own speech—they distance themselves from the kind of speaker who would speak that way unreflectively. So, they are not just describing or referring to ways of speaking; they are also projecting an image of themselves, one that would contrast with some other kinds of people. We can think of their behavior here as involving a kind of project, a kind of social action in which the authors in the thread create sociable alliance with other participants in the same thread, in contrast to some unnamed others—perhaps the working-class speakers referred to in the Wikipedia article. Because of such actions, I have often preferred not to talk about ideology but, instead, ideological work. Ideological constructs are not static, not things like rocks that hit you on the head, or dark clouds forever hanging over you, but instead, are formulations that start from assumptions, engage semiotic processes, and mobilize social projects (see Gal and Irvine 2019). They are part of a changing world, and though they may persist over a long time—or parts of them may—they may also evolve and shift. Now, what might be meant by “semiotic processes” on which such formulations might be based? Let me pick up on another bit of the Reddit thread: — I do notice if a Marylander does go up north like NY or MA people will pick up on the “southness” in your speech no matter how slight. — Same here, there's a bit of South here and there, but most of the comments are when I'm talking about technology. Anybody who came in from out of state tells me I pronounce it Dee ness and Gewgle.” What might it be about “talking about technology” that, reportedly, triggers outsiders' comments about “Southness” in speech? The outsiders seem to assume that there's a contradiction between sounding Southern and being techno-savvy. I am led to that idea partly from my own experience when I was 17 and went “up north” from Maryland to an elite university in Massachusetts. Most of my new acquaintances there came from New York or Massachusetts and—just as the Reddit author notes—they commented that I sounded “southern” to them; and they seemed to think that was funny. To me, in my teenage anxiety to do well in a demanding intellectual environment, I thought that meant they thought I was stupid. (If you think I was wrong, recall the thread author who wrote, about [faar], “Beats me why it's so hard to say a 4-letter word.”) So I tried changing my speech—and I did. What I thought I was doing was speeding it up, especially the vowels. The connections I was drawing for why “southern” speech might sound stupid came from a two-step process of ideological reasoning: (1) Southern speech = slow speech (while northern speech, from New York or Massachusetts = normal or fast speech); and: (2) Slow speech implies slow mind. Whether my speech at the time, or any other Maryland speech, was actually slower than the average rate in New England is uncertain. I have no evidence on the matter outside my own recollected guesswork. Nevertheless, whether they can be independently documented or not, these ideas about speed of talk and of behavior in general are commonly found; think of the expression, “in a New York minute,” metaphorically faster than a minute elsewhere. So this first step is an initial ideological move. Notice then that the second step, in which the quality of slowness is (supposedly) shared by speech and mental processes, relies on the Peircean notion of iconicity. The slow speed is an auditory image—an auditory icon—taken as depicting mental processing. In our first coauthored publications Gal and I called this kind of ideologized semiotic process iconization, as if an index (slow speech as pointer to southern origin) becomes an icon (of mental process). Later, we realized that it is important that the sign is taken to be an icon, rather than that it is one; so we drew on a different part of Peirce's scheme, and called this process rhematization. A rheme is a sign that is conjectured to be an icon, regardless of whether there's some concrete rationale for so identifying it.10 What does this have to do with the Reddit author's post about technology talk? To many Americans, I believe, skillful techno-talk means being smart and quick-minded; it also means being on the fast track and being modern. On that note, the many thread authors who, when harping on southernness, refer back to the American Civil War and even earlier—as in, “these families have been here forever, some from the 1600s”—seem to invoke a chronotope of the old South, of tradition. Accordingly, this familiar chronotope provides another reason southern speech might seem not modern, not part of the world of techno-talk. Let us go back now to the thread with the quick move from “southern accents” to whether “grits” are sold in grocery stores [three authors are represented in this excerpt]: — [After discussion of Maryland “southern accents”:] As for Maryland being a Southern state. It is and it isn't. But I figure any place where you can regularly find grits in the grocery store has to be at least a bit Southern. But don't call me a Southerner. And don't call me a Yankee either… — …Can I call you Federal Territory? — …You can find grits in the grocery stores in New Jersey. Nobody buys them, though. They might be the original grits that came with the store. What we see here is an example of how speech forms that index a place, and a kind of speaker associated with the place, regularly go along with other kinds of distinctions, such as among foods (as with grits, in this case), but potentially also among such things as types of clothing, hairstyles, houses, and so on. So just as Maryland (“southern” speech) goes with grits-in-stores—food that people buy because they do eat that—New Jersey speech would go with some other kind of food, not named here. The linguistic contrast between speech forms is bundled together with other contrasts, all indexing the region and its inhabitants. Gal and I have referred to this complex system as revolving around an axis of differentiation, where bundles of features contrast with other bundles according to a single principle of contrast (here, Southernness vs. Northernness, or Yankeeness). Notice that the bundled contrasts likely include aspects of economic and material life that are vulnerable to historical change, such as (in this case) the farming and fishing practices in which Maryland historically contrasted with northern regions.11 The bundle as a whole does not stand still. Another property of an axis of differentiation is that it allows the bundles it organizes to jump scales. The South/North axis manifested in the thread entries' discussion of differences can pertain to the broad regions divided by the Mason-Dixon line (which runs along the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania) and distinguishing, at the beginning of the Civil War, slave states from “free” states. That is doubtless the main frame of reference. But South/North can also pertain to narrower categorizations, such as regions within Maryland. The southern counties, identified by one of the thread authors as “south of Route 50 and Eastern Shore”—are taken to be more consistently “southern” in speech and other features, compared to northern counties and the area close to Washington DC. As it happens, the southern counties are also the area that was formerly devoted, like much of Virginia, to tobacco cultivation. (This is just a small illustration of an ideological process we have called fractal recursivity —by which the same principle of contrast can apply to categorizations at different degrees of encompassment.) Suppose now that we look again at the Wikipedia excerpt. As I mentioned earlier, it is evident that the Wikipedia entry has a different kind of authorship: this is an academic view, as opposed to a “folk” view. So even though none of these texts or thread entries have identifiable authors, the authorial stances are clearly distinct. Internally, too, these texts attend to different kinds of contrasts. There's nothing about the American South in the Wikipedia text, and almost nothing about race in the “folk” threads. We need to look at absences, at what people do not talk about, for their role in ideological work, as well as what people do talk about. Are the authors in the “folk” threads constructing a social world in which there are no Black people? Maybe; or maybe they just do not see Black speech as indexing locality in the same way (but why not?). In the Wikipedia entry, notice that the references to the working class (“white working-class families,” “white blue-collar Baltimoreans”) imply that there are other classes, but the entry does not mention them. What about middle- and upper-class speakers? Why are they absent? I suspect the Wikipedia authors do not see them as really “local”—perhaps assuming that these populations are more mobile, even cosmopolitan, thus not to be identified with “Baltimore” or “Maryland.” So, this omission is a bit of ideological work too. Perhaps it is similar to that standard-educated stance, distanced from the working class, that I suggested the folk authors were taking. Yet, there's an upper class in Maryland, “high society” families who have lived there for many generations—as long or even longer than the blue-collar residents of Baltimore City. A social register, called the “Blue Book,” lists these society families. I have never seen it, but I have been told that it only lists families that have been living there since before the Civil War, thus before 1861. What lessons can we draw from this excursion? There are several. First, that academic sociolinguists and other “experts” and researchers are not exempt from ideologies of language. We all do ideological work. Everybody draws on presumptions about the world that fit with their own projects. Second, that there are methodological pointers too. To see the ideological work that people do in talk, one should pay attention to the contrasts they draw, and notice not only what they say but what they leave out -- what people do not mention, especially if somebody else does. You need to compare points of view. Third, although I have worked mainly with written material for the purposes of this paper, for the larger argument it is not essential to deal with written texts. The approach to ideology I have been illustrating here is not the kind that focuses on policy, position papers, and other written texts, produced in big institutions, political movements, or grand “isms,” like capitalism, socialism, and so on. You can analyze those texts, and people have done so. But what I have been pointing to today is the ideological work in and about language in everyday life. That is something it is up to us, as linguistic anthropologists and sociolinguists, to study. One might want to call some of the everyday examples “metapragmatics,” but there is not some clear line between metapragmatics and ideology. Anything metapragmatic can be swept up in ideologies, or reveals them if pushed far enough; it is ideology all the way down. Regarding method, moreover, I have illustrated, in a small way, a research strategy that does not draw boundaries around a research object (such as “Maryland speech”), even if that object is the main concern. The reason is that boundaries and differences and the relations of contrast across boundaries—differences in viewpoints, contrasts between sets of people and places—are exactly things you want to know about. Instead, I took a very small bit of data from one morning's Google search and used it as a centerpiece from which to branch out. If I were interested in Maryland language ideologies in their own right, I would trace many of these branches, investigating thread authors, and pursuing observation and interviewing in real life, which could then be examined for many things, including contrasts between in-person talk and what people write about language in internet threads, and who does that internet posting. If I had no experience of the region I might need to start with some initial ethnographic orientation, but the main research would be from a centerpiece outward, following the connections drawn or implied in the data as I went along, treating boundaries and differences as a focus for investigation rather than its stopping points. Because these connections would include contrasts among non-linguistic features (like the south/north contrast in food preferences illustrated in the present case), this methodological point brings us back to the question—raised earlier in this paper—of how ideologies of language take part in broader ideologies of semiosis. Bounding off language from a material world not only limits how you analyze the phenomena you are calling “linguistic,” but also how you are analyzing the semiotics of other phenomena—as if they were isolated from talk about them or surrounding them. “Semiotics” must not seem to be about everything but language. It is helpful, instead, as I have suggested, to start with a centerpiece that is simply an object of joint attention, and explore the semiotic activity that surrounds it, both talk and other action. I prefer to start with something linguistic, as I have done in this paper (with my simple question posed as a Google search), and work from there, but other kinds of semiosis are present and ready to be considered from the outset. Talk, while depending on conventions of linguistic form, is also a physical activity of the body. It is accompanied by gestures, positionings, air currents, and sound that reaches near or far; and it can be represented in other material forms, such as the writing conveyed in internet sites. While I hope to have shown how one can discover differences in point of view, and an ideological axis of differentiation that bundles linguistic contrasts together with foods and other things, the strategy does not depend on starting from a linguistic object. In one chapter in our book Susan Gal and I illustrate an analytical strategy that starts from an object of attention having nothing ostensibly to do with language. It is an office door in which there is a pane of glass. But when we pursued the semiotic activity surrounding it—observing what people did with these doors, and how they talked about them; what stories they told about the doors, alleging why the pane of glass was there and why different people responded to the doors in different ways—we found that major ideological themes regarding discursive practices, social divisions, social positionings, and inequalities came to light. The early formulations with which I began this paper defined “linguistic ideology” (or “language ideology”) as a topic and domain for research. And it is still an important research topic. Yet, in the intervening years we have moved some distance from Silverstein's 1979 definition, although he too took important steps along the way, especially in the 1998 commentary I referred to earlier.12 I have devoted a lot of my discussion to the coauthored work I have done with Susan Gal, but there have been many other significant works as well, both theoretically oriented writings and case studies, by a growing list of authors.13 While I have not reviewed them all here, many of those works point in similar directions; it has been a conversation among many participants. Perhaps one of its most important moves—even for the study of language ideology—is actually a shift of focus away from “ideologies” (linguistic or semiotic) as objects, as wholes, as things to identify and describe. We move, instead, to the ideological work that is discoverable in semiotic activity and in the social projects those activities pursue. This shift opens a very broad avenue, both analytically and methodologically, for our future research.

25,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA10-2019-APSR.txt," Violent protests are dramatic political events, yet we know little about the effect of these events on political behavior. While scholars typically treat violent protests as deliberate acts undertaken in pursuit of specific goals, due to a lack of appropriate data and difficulty in causal identification, there is scant evidence of whether riots can actually increase support for these goals. Using geocoded data, we analyze measures of policy support before and after the 1992 Los Angeles riot—one of the most high-profile events of political violence in recent American history—that occurred just prior to an election. Contrary to some expectations from the academic literature and the popular press, we find that the riot caused a marked liberal shift in policy support at the polls. Investigating the sources of this shift, we find that it was likely the result of increased mobilization of both African American and white voters. Remarkably, this mobilization endures over a decade later. Riots are political acts in which participants engage in violence to express grievances and attempt to spur policy change. Scholars and journalists often claim that riots cause short- and long-term changes in political mobilization, attitudes, and behaviors, both among riot participants and those exposed to the riot as observers or victims. Classic survey evidence has demonstrated that rioters ascribe political motivations to their actions (Sears and McConahay Reference Sears and McConahay 1973), and scholars have argued that the series of riots in the 1960s caused shifts in the policy mood of the American electorate that had long-term consequences for national politics (Edsall and Edsall Reference Edsall and Edsall 1992; Manza and Uggen Reference Manza and Uggen 2006; Massey and Denton Reference Massey and Denton 1988; Olzak, Shanahan, and McEneaney Reference Olzak, Shanahan and McEneaney 1996; Rieder Reference Rieder 1985; Wasow Reference Wasow 2016; Western Reference Western 2006). Similar claims have also been made about political violence in other countries (Beber, Roessler, and Scacco Reference Beber, Roessler and Scacco 2014; De Waal, Reference De Waal 2005; Hayes and McAllister Reference Hayes and McAllister 2001). In the wake of continued violent protest in the United States and around the world, the subject of political violence has enduring importance. Footnote 1 But can riots actually change support for policy? Measuring the effect of a riot on public support for the policies said to motivate the rioters has been, as of yet, challenging. We address this question by examining local shifts in referendum voting on public goods targeted at urban-dwelling racial minorities after the 1992 Los Angeles riot. We find that the riot caused a shift in support for allocating these goods and that much of the shift is attributable to changes in mobilization among both African Americans and whites. We also find that this mobilization persists over time, evidence that the riot’s political consequences were long-term. In order to identify the effect of the riot on support for local referenda, we need not assume the underlying causes of the riot are unrelated to downstream changes in policy support. Rather, we assume the riot was exogenously timed relative to events planned long before, namely, an upcoming primary election. The triggering event for the 1992 Los Angeles riots was a video recording of police brutality and the subsequent acquittal of the police officers involved. Although the riot was a nonrandom event, the timing of the video recording and subsequent trial and conviction were unrelated to the timing of a primary election. We combine this exogenous timing with a difference-in-differences analysis of pre- and postriot policy voting to control for secular trends in policy support. This gives our analysis causal leverage not found in most previous studies of political violence. We further interrogate the validity of this causal claim by examining the spatial correlation between changes in policy support and the epicenter of the riot. We find that these changes were much more strongly correlated with distance from the riot than from other locations in Los Angeles, including other African American population centers. POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY By examining how a riot affected support for public goods allocation, our study addresses the effectiveness of rioting as a political activity. In doing so, we broaden our understanding of how political activity may contribute to policy change, a question that typically examines more common political behaviors, such as voting, lobbying, or nonviolent protest. While such activities are often argued to be ineffective, especially for low-status groups (Gilens Reference Gilens 2012) such as poor African Americans, we show that violent protest is an arguably efficacious political activity, insofar as it changes local policy support. Footnote 2 Not everyone views rioting as politically motivated and not all riot participants have the same motivations. However, social scientists often view rioting as a political act (e.g., Huntington Reference Huntington 1968) and classic studies of riots show that participant aims include demanding redress for political grievances (Sears and McConahay Reference Sears and McConahay 1973). Scholarly examinations of the 1992 Los Angeles riots tend to interpret the event as collective action against poor economic and social conditions, triggered by police brutality (Tierney Reference Tierney 1994). Indeed, postriot polls indicated that 67.5% of African Americans in Los Angeles County viewed the riots as a protest against unfair conditions (Bobo et al., Reference Bobo, Zubrinsky, Johnson and Oliver 1994). As such, in addition to immediate grievances such as police brutality, riots are often characterized as demands for policy reform (Fogelson and Hill Reference Fogelson and Hill 1968). In the United States, these policies include spending on public goods benefiting the urban poor, including education, housing, and poverty assistance. If participants riot in pursuit of policy, then understanding how riots affect policy support is important to understanding the effectiveness of rioting as a political tactic. Previous studies suggest that riots decrease support for racially liberal policies (Sears and McConahay Reference Sears and McConahay 1973; Wasow Reference Wasow 2016) or, conversely, that riots both increase negative attitudes toward the rioting group and increase support for the policies advocated by riot participants (Beber, Roessler, and Scacco Reference Beber, Roessler and Scacco 2014). But because previous scholarship was limited to measuring posttreatment outcomes, considerable uncertainty remains about whether the riots actually caused these changes. We concentrate on the effects of rioting on a local population. While the Los Angeles riots had national prominence, certain effects of the riot may have been localized—after all, a riot is a locally destructive event. Individuals close to the riot were more likely to be materially and psychologically impacted by the event and, as such, to be more motivated in the aftermath. Few studies have examined the localized effectiveness of a riot, rather than treating the events as part of a larger phenomenon (e.g., Western Reference Western 2006). While this broader focus can be valuable, it might mask differences between local and distal effects: for example, while the consensus in the literature that a riot makes citizens unsympathetic to the rioters may be accurate on a national scale, local opinion may become more sympathetic because of shared identity, special knowledge of local circumstances, or fear of further unrest. Additionally, examining the effects of a riot on national-level opinion, while potentially important, overlooks that much policy, especially in the domains of welfare and education, is controlled at the local or state level. THE 1992 LOS ANGELES RIOTS On March 3, 1991, four white Los Angeles police officers were videotaped beating an African American man named Rodney King. On April 29, 1992, a trial that had been relocated from Los Angeles to homogeneously white Ventura County concluded with an all-white jury acquitting the four officers of all criminal charges. Within hours of the verdict’s announcement, a series of violent and destructive incidents occurred around the intersection of Florence Avenue and Normandie Avenue in south central Los Angeles, a predominantly African American neighborhood. Reminiscent of the Watts Riots thirty years earlier, police officers abandoned the area, leaving residents to defend themselves against looters, arsonists, and widespread violence. For the next three days, the area suffered freeway shutdowns, suspension of municipal services, racially targeted violence, and destruction of property. The violence proceeded unchecked until May 3, when 3,500 federal troops arrived to supplement 10,000 members of the National Guard. On May 27, one week before the 1992 primary election, the last troops withdrew from the area. The Los Angeles riots had resulted in 54 deaths, more than 2,300 injuries, and over 11,000 arrests; estimates of material losses exceed $1 billion (CNN 2013). Much of the violence was covered live on television by news helicopters, including the beating and attempted murder of white truck driver Reginald Denny as he attempted to drive through the intersection of Florence and Normandie. Contemporary accounts of the events describe great anxiety among the white residents of Los Angeles. In the aftermath came a flurry of reporting, often backed by survey data, speculating on the riot’s effects on public opinion. Major themes in the media included an increase in fear and a recognition that the living conditions of urban minorities needed to change (Toner Reference Toner 1992). This initial view of aggregate opinion suggests that the riot represented a profound experience for Angelenos. Whether and how those experiences translated into policy support and mobilization is our focus. Despite the fear and destruction caused by the riot, less than a month later, voters in Los Angeles went to the polls in a statewide primary election for elected offices and ballot propositions. To understand the effects of the riot on voting in this election and in subsequent elections, we exploit the timing of this event to study changes in policy support. THE LOCAL EFFECTS OF VIOLENT PROTEST In order to test for the localized effect of a riot on policy support, we focus our study on the area of Los Angeles County closest to the riot. Unlike previous studies of riots that rely on aggregate units, we exploit geocoded individual- and precinct-level data to measure the effects of the riot on voters at any proximity to its epicenter, including those who lived in the immediate vicinity. Using individual voters avoids problems of aggregation, such as the modifiable areal unit problem and problems of scale (e.g., Enos Reference Enos 2017), that are common to this type of analysis. Los Angeles County is very large: spanning an area as roughly as size of Connecticut, it is the most populous county in the United States. As such, treating the effects of the riot as uniform across this area may mask important variation. As a principled way of defining “local,” so as to avoid making arbitrary choices about the relevant distance from the riot, we focus on voters who are not separated from the riot by topographic features that may lower the salience of the riot. We thus limit our study to the area known as the Los Angeles basin, consisting of parts of the city of Los Angeles and other municipalities. Footnote 3 With this, we exclude areas of the county further away from the riot, such as the desert communities to the east, and from areas that were separated from the riots by physical barriers, such as residents in the mountainous areas or in the San Fernando Valley, who were separated from the riot by the Santa Monica Mountains. Unless otherwise noted, data we describe below are limited to this area, which is within approximately thirty kilometers of Florence and Normandie, the geographic origin of the riot. We study two demographic groups: non-Hispanic whites and African Americans. Footnote 4 These groups had substantially different baselines in terms of preriot ideology and political involvement, as well as divergent on-the-ground and psychological experiences with the riot. African Americans, whether riot participants or not, were much more likely than whites to share a social identity with the rioters and perhaps to sympathize with their grievances. Whites were a priori less likely to share a social identity with the rioters or to agree with their actions. In a nationally representative survey fielded during the riot, when asked whether the violence of the riot “was justified by the anger that blacks in Los Angeles felt over the verdict in the trial,” only 17% of white respondents said it was, while 35% of African Americans did so. Footnote 5 The policy attitudes of the white population, compared to the African American population, were likely more heterogeneous, as most political conservatives in the area where white. In short, prior to the riot, whites, on average, would have been less likely to share the policy demands of the rioters than were African Americans. To estimate the effect of the riot, we use differences in support on ballot referenda between June 1990 and June 1992. We attribute differences in support and other behavior before and after to the effect of the riot. This is necessarily a “bundled treatment” because a riot is associated with changes on a number of fronts, including psychological effects, media coverage, action by politicians, changes in property values, and reactions to the verdict. The purpose of this study was not to isolate the effect of each of these treatments, but rather to speak to the overall effects of a riot. As a large-scale collective political act, a riot is not unlike other such large-scale political acts, such as campaigns, where scholars have measured overall effects without identifying precise mechanisms. As such, we use the phrase “effect of the riot” as short-hand for the bundled effect of all the treatments associated with the violent protest. The treatment effect we estimate is bundled in another sense. In addition to the direct effect of being proximate to the riot, other, more indirect, mass-mediated events associated with, but prior to, the riot, such as the beating of Rodney King or the subsequent trial, occurred during this period and could affect policy support. We assume, however, that these events did not affect voter behavior nearly as much as the riot itself: well-identified studies of events that receive large doses of media coverage, such as presidential campaigns, show that media exposure has minimal mobilizing effects (Huber and Arceneaux Reference Huber and Arceneaux 2007). The persuasive effects of exposure to these mass communications is also short-lived, lasting only several days (Hill et al. Reference Hill, Lo, Vavreck and Zaller 2013), not long enough to directly affect the voting behavior measured over a year after the beating itself and weeks after the end of the trial. This stands in contrast to the large and persistent mobilizing effects we observe here. Furthermore, as shown below, our estimates exhibit a spatial pattern that is consistent with a distinct effect of the riot itself, rather than a more general media effect. We also do not see changes in policy support in other parts of California that, while exposed to the beating and trial through media, were not proximate to the riot. Therefore, we believe that the effects we measure are likely attributable to the riot itself, not other associated events. Still, it is important to be clear that this bundle of treatments cannot be cleanly pulled apart. We focus on support for spending on public schools as a public good, which is associated with African Americans and racial minorities more generally and is often implicated in the social welfare demands of riot participants. Public schools have long been part of policy debates over how to address urban social and economic problems, including in official reports in the aftermath of urban rioting (California Governor’s Commission on the Los Angeles Riots 1963). Research has demonstrated that demographic considerations play a role in opinions about public school spending (Hopkins Reference Hopkins 2009), with the nonwhite composition of schools affecting white support for spending. In 1992, on the eve of the riot, the Los Angeles Unified School District was 72% non-Anglo-white. In areas near to the riots, public schools were even more nonwhite, with enrollment at the 20 schools closest to Florence and Normandie 55% African American and less than 1% white. Footnote 6 Our inferential strategy holds constant general attitudes about educational spending not associated with African Americans by comparing changes in support for public school spending to changes in support for university spending. We assume that attitudes about university spending are, at most, weakly linked to attitudes about African Americans and that funding higher education would not as widely be seen as a method of addressing problems made apparent by the riot. Thus, when white voters were asked to cast ballots with the demands of the African Americans rioters fresh in their minds, these demands would have no effect on votes about university spending. We believe this assumption is plausible: in our review of the literature, we found no scholarship claiming that attitudes about university spending were associated with attitudes about race or racial demographics. The riot may have changed local policy support through several channels, including mobilization, a general change in ideology or political outlook, or by altering the considerations citizens use when voting. The latter refers to the fact that most citizens do not have well-developed policy attitudes and so, when citizens form opinions, they are influenced by recent salient cues (Sands Reference Sands 2017; Zaller Reference Zaller 1992) which have been shown to influence vote choice (Berger, Meredith, and Wheeler Reference Berger, Meredith and Wheeler 2008). For citizens voting on questions of public policy so soon after the riot, the riot itself was likely one of these cues. Effects on White Policy Voting When the riot made salient to whites the policy demands of the rioters specifically, and African Americans more generally, in what direction might their support for spending on public schools move? We might expect a riot to increase support for spending by making white voters more aware of the needs of African Americans and the demands of the rioters. In particular, the signal generated by the extreme behavior of rioting may have caused them to update their opinions about the severity of the needs of the African American community. The riot may have also activated preexisting sympathy for these policy positions. Or, the destructiveness of the riot may have caused white voters to favor investment in programs that would prevent further violence (Beber, Roessler, and Scacco Reference Beber, Roessler and Scacco 2014). Among elites, there is a history of such reactions to riots in the United States. The Kerner Commission, formed by Lyndon Johnson, attributed the urban unrest of the late 1960s to a host of inadequate welfare institutions. The commission recommended reforms of social welfare programs to prevent further riots (United States National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders 1968). A report after the 1963 Watts riots by a commission chaired by then-CIA Director John McCone made similar recommendations on reforms, including for improved schooling for African American children (California Governor’s Commission on the Los Angeles Riots 1963). After the 1992 riot, there is evidence that voters nationwide drew similar lessons. A series of postriot surveys found that 65% of respondents agreed that “the violence in Los Angeles…has made it more urgent to address poverty” Footnote 7 and that 51% wanted to see an increased emphasis on providing social services, as compared to 37% who supported an increased emphasis on promoting law and order. Footnote 8 Moreover, 38% of respondents desired more spending for minorities in urban areas, while only 13% preferred decreased spending. Footnote 9 Perhaps the voters of the Los Angeles basin were also moved by the logic of needing improved social institutions and, thus, more spending to prevent future riots. However, when asked to make consequential decisions about spending rather than merely state preferences on a survey, would white voters of Los Angeles County, where the riot had the greatest impact, have the same liberal reaction? The literature offers reasons to predict that the riot would dissuade voters from spending on public goods associated with a racial out-group. It is well established that individuals display in-group bias in attitudes, behaviors, and resource allocation, all else equal (Fiske Reference Fiske 2000). This behavior, repeatedly observed in the laboratory, is often cited as one of the primary reasons for the well-established finding that diversity is negatively correlated with public goods provision cross-nationally (Alesina and Zhuravskaya Reference Alesina and Zhuravskaya 2008; Enos and Gidron Reference Enos and Gidron 2016; Habyarimana et al. Reference Habyarimana, Humphreys, Posner and Weinstein 2009). Scholars have drawn direct connections between local ethnic diversity and the willingness of voters to allocate funds for public goods, including schools (Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly Reference Alesina, Baqir and Easterly 1999; Rugh and Trounstine Reference Rugh and Trounstine 2011). Furthermore, research has shown that whites in the United States draw on negative stereotypes about African Americans when forming policy attitudes about benefits perceived to disproportionately target members of that racial group (Gilens Reference Gilens 1999). In laboratory experiments, making salient race or other group-based identities leads to group-based discriminatory attitudes and behaviors (Enos and Celaya Reference Enos and Celaya 2019; Reicher et al. Reference Reicher, Templeton, Neville, Ferrari and Drury 2016; Sidanius and Pratto Reference Sidanius and Pratto 2001). With negative stereotypes made salient by the televised images of violence and looting, it is possible that whites drew on these stereotypes when asked to make decisions about allocating to public schools. With this substantial literature in mind, we might also predict that the riot, which brought attitudes about the out-group to bear on voting decisions, would precipitate a decrease in support for those public goods. Effects on African American Policy Voting African Americans’ perspectives on the riot were likely different from those of white voters because a group with whom they share a racial identity participated in widespread violent protest. Given the strong connection between group identity and policy attitudes, grounded in shared history (Dawson Reference Dawson 1995), the riot may have increased African Americans’ awareness of in-group policy demands, thereby causing a shift in attitudes. Salient political events, such as electoral campaigns, can help citizens learn about the policy preferences of groups with which they share an identity. This learning process can bring attitudes into line with the dominant attitude of the group (Lenz Reference Lenz 2013). This might occur because voters use group membership as a heuristic for the “right attitude,” which they adopt upon learning about the group’s preferences (Cohen Reference Cohen 2003). The salient politicized event of a riot could serve the same function as a campaign: as the policy demands of the rioters are extensively covered by the media and transmitted through social networks, the attitudes of people who identify with the rioters may change to reflect these demands. Of course, African Americans in Los Angeles may have already had largely liberal policy preferences and attitudes that were crystallized before the riot; if so, the riot itself may have little or no effect on their attitudes. However, we think it unlikely that the riot could cause a decrease in support for spending among African Americans. DATA AND ESTIMATION PROCEDURE We analyze paired ballot initiatives related to funding for education. To isolate the effect of the riot, we examine votes on two related sets of public goods: public schools, which were closely linked to African Americans and may have been seen as a way to address to policy concerns of the rioters, and universities, which were not linked to African Americans and were, at most, a very indirect way to address the policy concerns of the rioters. We focus on four initiatives that appeared on the ballot in the two June elections: Propositions 121 and 123 in 1990 and Propositions 152 and 153 in 1992. These propositions are summarized in Table 1. We leverage the symmetry of ballot initiatives from 1990 to 1992. Both elections include both a public school and a university education initiative. Moreover, the monetary amounts associated with both 1992 initiatives are approximately twice the 1990 amounts. We estimate a difference-in-differences from these four ballot initiatives: PubSchooli1992 indicates precinct i’s support for the public school initiative in 1992, measured as the votes cast in support of that ballot initiative divided by the total ballots cast. The same convention holds for PubSchooli1990, HigherEdi1992, and HigherEdi1990. Thus, EdDiffi is the change in support for public schools in precinct i between 1990 and 1992, net the change in support for universities. Our primary quantities of interest are the population-weighted mean of EdDiffi for all voters, and for white and African American voters separately. By “differencing out” the change in support for universities from the change in support for public schools, we substantially reduce the threat of omitted variable bias. Our estimate of the effect of the riot on public school spending would be biased if there were a shock to support for university funding between 1990 and 1992 that was not also a shock to public school funding. For example, a change in the composition of the local electorate could be problematic if voters in one year prioritize one type of education spending over the other for reasons unrelated to the riot. It is possible that such changes in the composition of the electorate could be induced by changes in the competitiveness of contests across elections. In Online Appendix A, we explore this possibility by subsetting our analysis based on competitiveness and are able to rule out this potential source of confounding. We also show that there are no shifts similar to those we observe in Los Angeles County elsewhere in the state, indicating that the validity of our design is not threatened by statewide shocks. Because our estimation strategy nets out any secular change in, for example, voter ideology, we believe we have isolated the change in support for public schools that is due to the riot. To further isolate the effect of the riot, we also check for correlations between EdDiff and distance from the riot. As noted below, significant correlations between these variables give us confidence that we are isolating the riot’s effect; for an omitted variable to bias our estimate, it would have to be correlated with both distance and EdDiff. Footnote 10 To acquire precinct-level data, we digitized vote returns from the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder County Clerk’s Elections Division. These data allow us to examine the general effects of the riot. However, while we know the total vote outcomes and the racial demographics for each precinct, to understand the distinct voting patterns of different racial groups requires individual-level vote data. This presents an “Ecological Inference Problem” (Robinson Reference Robinson 1950). We use the Ecological Inference methods developed by King ( Reference King 1997) to isolate behavior by racial group. While, as with all estimation techniques, this method relies on assumptions for validity, the technique has been validated on well-known problems (O’Loughlin Reference O’Loughlin 2000) and used for inference in other important questions (Enos Reference Enos 2016). We discuss the assumptions as they apply to our data in Online Appendix B. The inputs to the EI model are the proportion of whites, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and others in each precinct, and the proportion of Yes votes out of total ballots cast for each initiative. The outputs are estimates of what proportion of each group voted Yes on a given ballot initiative, for each precinct in our data. With these outputs, we separately measure EdDiffi for whites and African Americans using the equation above. Footnote 11 Our measures of precinct-level demographics, including the racial characteristics of each precinct, come from the California Statewide Database, which merges local voter files and decennial US Census data with precinct geographies to create demographic counts by precinct. To account for the uncertainty in the EI estimates, we weight all group-specific estimates by the inverse of the standard errors of the EI estimates (Adolph et al. Reference Adolph, King, Herron and Shotts 2003; King Reference King 1997). Our final precinct-level dataset consists of 1,676 precincts. Footnote 12 To explore mobilization, we use data from the 1992 Los Angeles County voter file, which include 3,743,468 registered individuals, and contains address, gender, age, and party registration information for each person. We also use these data to geocode precincts because precinct-level GIS data from this time period do not exist; we geocode every address from the 1992 Los Angeles County voter file Footnote 13 and calculate population-weighted precinct centroids from the addresses of every voter in the precinct. To validate these geocodes, a team of research assistants used Google Earth to digitize precinct maps. This geocoding procedure allows us to measure the distance of voters and precincts from the riot and to validate our claim that changes in policy support were caused by the riot. We measure the geospatial distance between the origin of the riot at Florence and Normandie and the interior centroid of the voting precincts used in our analysis. Footnote 14 We supplement the voter file with imputed information about the voters’ race by merging the voter file with two additional data sets: 1990 Census Block-level race and ethnicity data, and the Census surname list, which indicates the probability of belonging to each race given a surname. Using the surname probability as a prior, we apply Bayes’ Rule to compute the posterior probability that an individual is White, Hispanic, African-American, Asian, Native American, or other, conditioning on their address and surname (Enos Reference Enos 2016). Footnote 15 From this vector of posterior probabilities, we identify the race with highest probability and use it as the imputed race of the voter. Such imputations have been successfully validated in prior research: comparing imputed race to self-reported race using the Florida voter file, Imai and Khanna ( Reference Imai and Khanna 2016) show a false-positive rate in identifying African American registrants of less than three percent. The Los Angeles basin is more racially segregated than Florida, which increases the accuracy of imputation, and we are confident that by incorporating geography into race imputations our imputations are similarly accurate (see Online Appendix H for details). Mobilization Data From the 1992 voter file, we measure the change in partisan registration between the period just before to the period just after the riot. We do this by comparing a one-week window on either side of the riot, which lasted from April 29 to May 3. This means we compare a preriot period of April 22 to April 28 and a postriot week of May 4 to May 8. In the preriot week, we omit the Saturday and Sunday of April 25 and 26. Note that these periods contain the same days of the week, which is advantageous because registration tends to vary by day of the week. However, if voters are more likely to register in weeks closer to the registration deadline, our pre–post comparison may be confounded. The coincidence of the timing of the riot vis-à-vis the voter registration deadline of May 4 allows us to overcome this problem. Because the riot occurred in the days leading up to the registration deadline and prevented people from registering, election officials announced after the riot that they would extend the registration deadline by four days. This provides a unique opportunity because it means there are two roughly equal periods of time prior to the registration deadline. Prior to the riot, citizens had no way of knowing that the deadline would be extended and thus would register as normal. After the riot, a new deadline appeared and everyone who was motivated to register because of the riot was able to do so. In this way, we can capture the marginal effect of the riot on the propensity of certain groups to register, while controlling for seasonal and other unobserved trends that also affect registration. Attitude Data We use individual-level survey data from the Los Angeles County Social Survey (LACSS) to measure attitude change. The LACSS, conducted annually from 1992 to 1998 (University of California, Los Angeles. Institute for Social Science Research 2011), captured a county-representative sample generated by Random Digit Dialing. The 1992 LACSS, themed “Ethnic Antagonism in Los Angeles,” provides a picture of racial attitudes and policy preferences expressed by a random sample of Angelenos before and after the riots. By coincidence, the verdict and the riot occurred in the middle of survey implementation, enabling us to leverage variation in survey responses recorded immediately before and after this exogenous shock, as done by Bobo et al. ( Reference Bobo, Zubrinsky, Johnson and Oliver 1994). Long-Term Data Finally, to examine long-term partisanship and participation, we merge the 1992 Los Angeles County voter file with a statewide California voter file from 2005. This was the earliest voter file we could obtain that included voter turnout data. By examining names, gender, and date of birth of the 30,166 voters who registered in the 10 weekdays before and after the riot, we successfully locate 15,244 of them in the 2005 file. Our calculations suggest that after accounting for voters who moved out of state, died, or changed their name, we successfully locate a high proportion of our sample who were still registered in 2005. We detail this matching process in Online Appendix F. RESULTS: CHANGES IN POLICY SUPPORT We first consider the change in Angelenos’ support for public school spending as a result of the riot. If, on average, the riot served as a negative shock to support for public school funding, then the mean of EdDiffi should be negative. If instead the riot served as a positive shock for support public school funding, then the mean of EdDiffi should be positive. These results do not rely on ecological estimates and, therefore, there is no model-based uncertainty around the result. The distribution of EdDiffi is displayed in the top panel of Figure 1. The vertical dotted line is at the mean of the distribution. Pooling together all precincts in the Los Angeles basin, we see a population-weighted mean EdDiffi of 0.049 (95% confidence interval: [0.037, 0.061]), indicating that average support for public schools, net of the change in support for higher education, increased. Footnote 16 Voters proximate to the riots experienced a large positive shift in their support for public schools, accounting for their overall shift in support for education. Because public schools are a public good closely associated with issues related to the riot and to the social identity of the rioters (as African Americans), this provides initial evidence that the riot was effective in generating support for the rioters’ policy demands. Comparing these results to the same difference-in-differences in other parts of California bolsters the claim that this effect is due to the riot and not events associated with the riot or other unmeasured shocks. The county-wide difference-in-differences for Los Angeles County was 0.003. The statewide difference-in-differences was also close to zero (−0.004) and the county-level difference-in-differences in other large, urban counties not experiencing the riot, such as Alameda County (−0.004), San Diego County (−0.007), and San Francisco County (−0.009), were also close to zero. These other counties were exposed to the mass-mediated events of the televised beating and the trial, but were not exposed to the treatment of having such a large and damaging riot nearby. Results by Race The weighted means for both whites (0.028, CI: [0.018, 0.039]) and, especially, African Americans (0.073, CI: [0.066, 0.081]) demonstrate an increased willingness to pay for public schools relative to universities (see bottom panels of Figure 1). Also evident in Figure 1, the distribution of EdDiffi is wider for whites than it is for African-Americans, reflecting more variation in responses to the riot, as might be expected given more preriot heterogeneity among white voters in terms of distributive preferences. Footnote 17 The larger and more uniform shift by African Americans compared to whites is consistent with the claim that these changes are responses to the riot and not something else, and suggests that a significant portion of the effect of violent protest on policy support comes from rallying support from people sharing an identity with the rioters, rather than from gaining support from outside groups. This initial evidence establishes that a riot can be locally effective in driving policy support, whereby members of the public, even those ostensibly the target of the riot (whites) and especially those sharing an identity with the rioters (African Americans), vote in accordance with the preferences of the rioters. Changes in Policy Support by Distance from the Riot We now present tests designed to better establish that the changes we observe were caused by the riot itself and are not a spurious association. Because we lack sufficient data to show parallel trends—the standard validity check in difference-in-differences analyses—we turn instead to correlations between distance from the riot and the magnitude of change in policy support to buttress our causal claims and provide evidence that the effect we identify is driven primarily by the riot rather than other events that occurred in this period. Because the salience of an event often varies with a subject’s proximity to that event (Latané Reference Latané 1981), if changes in policy support were caused by the riot, then we would expect these changes to be correlated with distance from the riot. Note that the direction of this effect may cut both ways; changes in support for public schools may increase or decrease with distance. Since the overall effect of the riot was an increase in support for school spending, we might expect this increase to be largest nearer to the center of the riots. However, there could be psychological forces that diminish as proximity to riot increases: research has demonstrated that traumatic events, such as violence, can induce increased discrimination toward the out-group because of basic psychological motivations to look to the in-group for protection during threat (Navarrete and Fessler Reference Navarrete and Fessler 2005) or because fear induces a need for belief-reinforcing self-esteem (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, and Solomon Reference Greenberg, Pyszczynski and Solomon 1986). To examine the relationship between distance and EdDiff, we plot distance from Florence and Normandie against the population-weighted precinct-level estimates of EdDiffi in Figure 2. The overall negative linear trend suggests that those who live closer to the riots experience a greater increase in their support for public schools than voters who live further away. In Online Appendix C, we show analogous plots for white and African American voters, respectively, using EI-derived precinct-level estimates, showing similar negative linear trends. We also estimate weighted precinct-level regressions treating EdDiffi as our dependent variable and distance as our explanatory variable for all voters, as well as for white and for African American voters separately. As is expected from Figure 2, the estimated coefficient on distance for voters is negative and statistically significant. That policy support change is correlated with distance from the riot reinforces the claim that the observed shifts were in response to the riot and not to some spurious variable. In order for an observed or unobserved variable to threaten the validity of our analysis, it must be correlated with both EdDiff, the difference in the change in voting over time, and with our measure of distance from the riots. Furthermore, this is evidence that the effect we measure in EdDiff is the effect of the riot itself and not of other related events, such as the media coverage of the trial or the beating: these treatments were applied to all residents of Los Angeles and California equally via their television sets, and would not be correlated with distance from the location of the riot. Changes in Policy Support by Distance from Other Places in Los Angeles As a placebo test, we check for relationships between EdDiff and distance from locations other than Florence and Normandie. In particular, we test for a similarly strong correlation between distance and other areas in Los Angeles County with a high concentration of African Americans. This allows us to look for changes in behavior of African American voters generally or for changes in the behavior of white voters living near large concentrations of African Americans, other than those near the riot. Such a relationship would be evidence that something other than distance from the riot is shaping behavior, perhaps a “threat effect” of being proximate to an out-group (Enos Reference Enos 2016), rather than to the riot itself. To do this, we define a geographic area affected by the riot by drawing a one standard deviation ellipse (Wang, Shi, and Miao Reference Wang, Shi and Miao 2015) around the locations of all deaths attributed the riot. Footnote 18 We then take the top quartile of precincts in all of Los Angeles County in terms of number of black voters, yielding 972 precincts, and overlay the location of these precincts with the ellipse defining the area affected by the riot to determine if they are inside or outside the “riot area,” so defined. Then, as we did in Figure 2 for distance from Florence and Normandie, we calculate the distance to each of these top quartile black precincts from every other precinct in our data. For each of these precincts, we regress EdDiff on distance using these alternative distance measures. We then compare the magnitudes of the resulting coefficient estimates for precincts inside of the riot area and precincts outside of the riot area. The mean coefficient on distance for precincts inside the riot area is −0.02 and outside is −0.01. A t-test for difference of means of these distributions yields t = 10.70, indicating that the magnitude of coefficients in the riot area are significantly larger than those outside the riot area. In Figure 3, we display these coefficients on a map. Each of the high population African American precincts is marked by a point that is scaled by the absolute value of the coefficient on distance estimated from regressing EdDiff on distance from that point, with larger points indicating larger coefficients. The black ellipse marks the area most affected by the riot. Note that the coefficients on distance from other concentrations of African Americans are small compared to those in the riot area. For example, those west of the riot in the Venice neighborhood or northeast of the riot in the Pasadena area are relatively small. This is further evidence that it was the riot itself, rather than associated events that presumably would have affected residents in other areas similarly, that caused the shift in voting behavior. EXPLORING POSSIBLE MECHANISMS FOR INCREASES IN POLICY SUPPORT We have shown that Los Angeles voters increased their support for spending on public schools after the riot, holding constant support for spending on education more generally. Public education is a policy area associated with urban poverty and implicated in the demands of the rioters. This change, we claim, was a reaction to the riot, implying that violent protest can be locally effective in increasing support for policy demands. We demonstrated that the change in support was much greater for African Americans than for whites, that changes in support were correlated with distance from the riot, and that changes in support were more weakly related to distance from other locations. We now turn to testing the mechanisms for this phenomenon by examining attitude change, moving and demobilization, and increases in mobilization. While we cannot establish definitive connections between these variables and shifts in policy support, we believe the data more convincingly point to mobilization as the primary driver of the change. Attitude Change The LACSS data, the collection of which spanned the weeks surrounding the riot, allow us to test whether changes in aggregate policy support were accompanied by changes in attitudes among survey participants. Detailed analysis for this section can be found in Online Appendix D. The validity of our claims in this section rests on the assumption that those selected to be surveyed prior to the verdict are not systematically different from those sampled afterward. To test this assumption, we examine balance on available covariates separately for whites and African Americans before and after the riot. The white sample is small (n = 185) and fails this balance test. As such, we do not examine changes in white policy attitudes. African American subjects, on the other hand, are well balanced across pre- and postriot samples and comprise a sufficiently large sample (n = 426). Regressions based on these survey results suggest that, despite changes in aggregate voting behavior, African American support for spending on “improving our nation’s education system,” as well as ideology on a liberal to conservative scale, remained constant postriot, suggesting that attitude change is not responsible for the shift in policy support by African Americans. Moving and Demobilization Another possible explanation for changes in policy support is that citizens exited the electorate due to the riot or to other, nonriot related, factors occurring at the time. Citizens may have moved, or simply “hunkered down” after the violence. Perhaps, for example, citizens opposed to spending on public education disproportionately moved out of the basin after the riot. Although difficult to test directly, we believe it is implausible that citizens relocated en masse within the brief intervening time period between the riot and the June election. On the other hand, that citizens hunkered down and chose not to participate because of the riot seems more plausible. If this occurred, it would be evident in changes in voter turnout rather than registration rates. Hunkering down is not immediately apparent in the data: turnout among registered voters in Los Angeles County increased by 10.6 percentage points between the 1990 and 1992 June elections. However, changes in turnout must be considered in light of secular changes that typically occur between a midterm election year, like 1990, and a presidential election year, like 1992. Because turnout will be higher in a presidential year, decreases in turnout caused by the riot may have been masked by this secular trend. However, this does not appear to be the case in Los Angeles County because the increase in turnout between 1990 and 1992 was unusually high: it was higher than the average change of 6.0 percentage points in the next five largest California counties. Footnote 19 This 10.6 percentage point increase was also higher than the average change in turnout in Los Angeles County between the two previous midterm and presidential primaries (2.1 percentage points) and the following two midterm and presidential primaries (7.6 percentage points). Contrary to a hunkering down mechanism, it appears that voter turnout did not decrease in Los Angeles because of the riot, and in fact increased dramatically. This leads us to suspect that a change in mobilization, rather than moving or demobilization, is the more likely cause of aggregate change in policy support. Mobilization Salient political events, such as elections, can cause voters to become active in politics through increased voter registration (Meredith Reference Meredith 2009). Could citizens have become politically active because the riot raised their interest in politics, or because politicians used the riot to mobilize voters? On the one hand, the riot may have mobilized African American voters who saw members of their in-group intensely involved in politics, serving as a cue for the importance of political involvement or allowing for network effects to activate political participation. Violent protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 and Baltimore, Maryland, in 2015 were followed by other forms of political participation in African American communities, such as continued protest via the Black Lives Matter movement. On the other hand, the scholarly literature also describes riots as a form of political action undertaken because other forms are ineffective or unavailable (Sears and McConahay Reference Sears and McConahay 1973). Thus, it is possible that African Americans, having turned to rioting because of frustration with more mainstream forms of participation, will not be mobilized by the riot into mainstream politics. White voters may also be mobilized by the salient political event of the riot, but the ideological direction of the mobilization is less clear than for African Americans. Both conservative and liberal politicians may have exploited the event to register sympathetic voters. While previous scholarship finds that African American political activism, especially when violent, leads to a conservative backlash in voting among whites, these studies do not explore voter registration and so it is unclear whether this backlash comes from newly mobilized voters. Alternately, low-propensity voters are also more likely to be Democrats (Enos, Fowler, and Vavreck Reference Enos, Fowler and Vavreck 2014), so it may be previously unregistered Democrats who are most motivated by riots causing a liberal uptick in registration. Because we measure mobilization through changes in voter registration, we cannot separate political conversion, where voters who would have registered anyway register with a different party, from pure mobilization, where voters who would not otherwise have registered do so because of the riot. However, in the survey data, we see little ideological change among African Americans and, as we show below, levels of new registration were unusually high after the riot. Thus, we have some reason to believe our findings primarily reflect pure mobilization rather than conversion. The riot appears to have a significant mobilizing effect. We calculate that in the week after the riot, despite the passage of the original registration deadline, 24,587 Los Angeles basin residents registered to vote. In the 20 weeks leading up to the riot, the mean number of registrants per week was 3,614 and the median was 3,292. In the week immediately prior to the riot, with the registration deadline looming, 5,579 people registered. A question remains as to whether this spike in registration was simply due to pent-up demand, i.e., a result of those who would have registered anyway but were prevented by the riot from doing so, or whether it reflects those who would not have otherwise registered in the absence of the riot. Definitively isolating these two groups is impossible, but comparisons to other elections suggest that this spike reflects registration by those who would otherwise not have registered. The 2004 presidential primary in California provides a reasonable baseline because, as in 1992, the primary election involved choosing a Democratic candidate to run against an incumbent Republican president in the general election. Prior to the 2004 presidential primary, 31% of Angelenos who registered in the four weeks prior to the deadline did so in the last five weekdays leading up to the deadline. Meanwhile, those who registered in the five weekdays before the new post-riot registration deadline in 1992 represent 45% of those who registered in the preceding four weeks. In Online Appendix E, we extend this comparison to registration in 1990 and between 2003 and 2005 and show the postriot registration surge was unusually high compared to other years. Not only did the riot appear to be a mobilizing force but also it appears to have registered a different demographic than those registering in the absence of a riot. Using the covariates available in the voter file, we observe systematic differences in the composition of those who registered just before and just after the riot. We summarize these data in Table 2. Notably, compared to those registering before the riot, those registered after the riot are of similar age, but are more likely to be African American, less likely to be white, more likely to be female, and more likely to live closer to Florence and Normandie. The increased registration of people in these demographic groups is consistent with a mobilizing effect of the riot, and the increased mobilization of African Americans geographically close to the riot who are more likely to be low income than those further away is consistent with the mobilization of a group concerned with a particular interest in public primary education. This helps to explain how mobilization could cause the shift in support for primary education funding relative to higher education funding. We also examine whether the probability that new voters register as Democrats or Republicans differs in the riot’s aftermath. We display these results in Table 3, where Pr(Reg Republican) is the proportion of registrants who affiliated with the Republican party out of the total new registrants for the two parties, and Pr(Reg Democratic) is the proportion who registered as Democrats. Consistent with the overall liberalizing effect of the riot, both white and African American voters decreased Republican registration and increased Democratic registration; however, given the already very high Democratic identification among African Americans voters, the changes among this group are small. Footnote 20 How much did this mobilization contribute to the change in policy support? Our ballot data indicates that in 1990, 10,710 individuals in the LA basin voted for or against higher education bonds but abstained from voting one way or the other on public school bonds. By 1992, however, 17,301 more ballots were cast on the public school bond initiative than the higher education bond initiative. Although it is impossible to determine precisely how much of this 28,011 vote difference was due to the mobilizing effect of the riot, we note that the 24,587 people registered in the wake of the riot could represent a large portion of that shift. Footnote 21 Furthermore, a relatively large proportion of new registrants were African Americans, the voters who appear to have shifted the most in support of public schools based on the precinct results. As noted above, the riot may have increased mobilization through a variety of channels and, as such, is a bundled treatment. The increase could come from a piqued interest in politics that results directly from the riot or from the indirect effect of politicians using the riot to mobilize supporters. However, these shifts are particularly notable because such large-scale changes in party registration over this short of a period do not usually occur in modern American politics (e.g., Erikson, MacKuen, and Stimson Reference Erikson, MacKuen and Stimson 2002; Green, Palmquist, and Schickler Reference Green, Palmquist and Schickler 2002), suggesting that the riot had dramatic political consequences. LONG-TERM SHIFTS IN REGISTRATION AND PARTICIPATION Not only was the apparent change in mobilization caused by the riot dramatic, but this mobilization might have downstream significance as those mobilized may remain active in politics and influence electoral outcomes at a later date. We check for the long-term persistence of both party identification and voter participation among those mobilized by the violent protest to get a glimpse of the long-term impact of the protest. Voters are socialized by salient events that shape their long-term partisanship, so we might believe that voter registration resulting from the riot will show greater partisan stability than usual. However, the riot being an extraordinary event, possibly used by politicians to register voters who would otherwise not be registered, might mean that voter participation activated by the riot will wane over time. If the mobilization from the riot appears short-lived, this arguably reduces the significance of the mobilization we attribute to the riot. But, if the mobilized voters remain active, this suggests that the riot may have long-term significance. Merging the 1992 voter file with the 2005 file allows us to observe the behavior of those exposed to the riot, over a decade after it occurred. In Table 4, we show changes in party registration probabilities between 1992 and 2005 for white and African American voters, among those who registered immediately before or after the riots. Both white and African American voters who registered after the riots were more likely to register as Democrats, and less likely to register as Republicans, in 1992. Looking at those same individuals in 2005, party registration is highly consistent, with those registering after the riot, regardless of party, as likely, if not more likely, than those registering before to have the same partisan affiliation in 2005 as they did in 1992. Among white voters, 82% of Democrats and 77% of Republicans registering after the riot kept their party affiliation, comparable to those registering before the riot. For African Americans, 87% of Democrats registered after the riot remained Democrats. This is identical to the stability for Democrats before the riot and higher than the stability for whites. African American Republicans show considerably less stability, but their number is small. We can benchmark this degree of partisan stability against results reported in Green, Palmquist, and Schickler ( Reference Green, Palmquist and Schickler 2002), who argued that partisan identity is a social identity after comparing its long-term stability to other important identity categories, such as race and religion. Using survey panel data, they report that between 1992 and 1996, 78% of partisans kept their same affiliation. In our data, those registering in Los Angeles in 1992 in the wake of the riot were at least as likely, if not more likely, to keep their same partisan affiliation. Having established that the people who registered just after the riot differ from those who register just before, and that the latter’s partisan affiliations largely persist years later, we turn to the question of long-term participation. In tables in Online Appendix G, we examine the difference in turnout in the 2004 primary and general elections for those registering before and after the riot by regressing turnout in those elections on a variable indicating whether an individual registered immediately before or after the riot. Notably, both with demographic controls and without, for both whites and African Americans, over 10 years after the riot the estimated coefficient on registering before or after the riot does not attain statistical significance, and, in several cases, is a precisely estimated zero. This indicates that those who were motivated to register by the riot voted just as regularly as those registering under normal circumstances, even when holding constant demographic differences. This is true even in primary elections where participation is often limited to the most politically active citizens. Combined with the stability of partisanship, the long-term mobilization of postriot registrants as regular participators is a sign of the potential long-term significance of the riot: citizens appear to have joined the party sympathetic to the demands of the rioters and not only remained in that party, but remained active voters. If the shift in policy support observed in the referendum voting remains reflected in the long-term vote choices of these citizens, this speaks to the long-term ability of rioting to affect policy support. DISCUSSION This study provides evidence for a plausible effect of violent protest on local policy support. Our results indicate that a riot can help build support for policy or symbolic goals by mobilizing supporters or building sympathy among others. We demonstrate that white and African American voters were mobilized to register, that new registrants tended to affiliate as Democrats, and that voters shifted their policy support toward public schools, net of a general shift in support for education spending. This mobilization appears to have persisted: those mobilized by the riot remained regular participators over a decade later and remained more Democratic than the general population, even after accounting for demographics. Yet, our policy support finding is somewhat inconsistent with previous literature. In both the US and other contexts scholars have found that political violence is associated with a “backlash” effect; voters behave unsympathetically toward the perceived rioting group. In the United States, this means increased support for socially and politically conservative candidates and policies. A common argument in the literature is that the string of riots in the 1960s caused large swaths of white voters to abandon support for the liberal welfare state, which, especially since the Great Society of Lyndon Johnson, had been rhetorically framed around curing inner-city poverty associated with African Americans. Those riots are said to have caused changes in partisanship and voting behavior that ushered in the rise of Nixon and Reagan-era conservatism that still affects American politics today. There are numerous plausible explanations for the differences between our findings and prior research. For example, it may be the case that the series of riots in the 1960s had nonlinear effects; perhaps, while a single riot invokes sympathy, a series of riots provokes backlash. Similarly, the difference between local and nonlocal effects may also be consequential: those observing the riot from afar may lack sympathy because they do not share an identity with the rioters. Furthermore, much of the previous literature examining the political effects of urban riots in the United States neglects whether those riots helped galvanize African American voters, a population that could be consequential in local policy voting, especially given the large populations of African Americans in the areas where riots occurred. Of course, the divergence between local support and nonlocal backlash could affect the overall efficacy of violent protest. Our findings may also differ because of the distinct context of the riots being studied—perhaps, Los Angeles was unusually sympathetic to demands of the rioters. However, this explanation is unlikely given that Los Angeles County in the early 1990s was the type of place in which one would a priori expect a backlash against a riot. At that time, Southern California was considered a conservative stronghold in a Republican-leaning state; between 1900 and 1992, California elected only three Democrats as governor. Theoretical and contextual considerations aside, there may also be methodological reasons to explain the differences. Despite making widespread claims about the effects of riots, most previous studies lack reliable evidence about whether riots actually cause the changes ascribed to them. To our knowledge, there have been no well-identified studies of the effects of violent protest on policy support. Footnote 22 Rather, to understand the effects of riots, scholars have had to depend on posttreatment measures of single riots or cross-sectional studies of riots across multiple cities. Such cross-sectional studies must rely on the strong assumption that a riot’s occurrence is uncorrelated with other variables that may affect politics downstream. Given that policy-oriented and scholarly accounts of riots treat them as nonrandom events caused by particular social and institutional forces (Olzak, Shanahan, and McEneaney Reference Olzak, Shanahan and McEneaney 1996; United States National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, 1968), this assumption seems implausible. In fact, the use of cross-sectional data presents an acute threat of bias when estimating the effects of riots on behavior that may explain why previous studies have associated riots with a backlash. If there is a preexisting trend in attitudes or policies to which rioters are reacting—that is, if riots are motivated by actions or policies that reflect locally unfavorable treatment or opinion by the majority, as the scholarly literature asserts—then public opinion measured after a riot will be confounded by the conservative shift already underway. CONCLUSION We focus on violent protest as a political tool for a low-status group in the United States. While other scholarship has examined other forms of political action and asked if it is efficacious for racial minorities and other low-status groups (Verba et al. Reference Verba, Schlozman, Brady and Brady 1995), the scholarly literature has largely failed to ask whether rioting is a useful tool for building policy support, even though, from the perspective of the rioters, this question is paramount. Here we show that violent political protest can spur political participation among people who share an identity with the rioters. Although it often seems extreme from the American perspective, political violence is not isolated to particular regions or eras and is still common in many parts of the world. Moreover, the implicit threat of violence underlies the relationship between governments and citizens in many places. As the use of violence continues to be an active feature of our political system, our findings and approach may help future scholars better understand this important topic."
26,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA2 - 2022 - Postracial Policing.txt," After decades of denigration and targeting by the state, Singlish�or Singaporean Colloquial English�has come into its own as a �uniquely Singaporean� phenomenon (Wee 2018), both a source and site of projects of raciolinguistic value-creation (Rosa and Flores 2017). Today, Singlish is often presented as emblematic of broader �racial harmony� among Singapore�s four official races, yet it has also become an arena for articulating and rejecting critiques of racialized Chinese-Singaporean majoritarian privilege. This paper analyzes interviews with literary producers, public presentations by artists, and published mediatized texts in which Singlish comes into being as a site of ideological contestation. It describes two contrastive figures and the discourse registers through which they are materialized: first, postracial policing, voiced as an insistence that Singlish is sui generis, and second, �Mother Tongue� sourcing, voiced as an insistence on adherence, in spelling and pronunciation, to the racialized �Mother Tongue� varieties (and their racialized speakers) from which Singlish items are sourced. I argue that these two figures and enregistered positions co-participate in the production of an image of standard: a felt sense of standard-likeness that emerges as an effect of aesthetic textuality (Nakassis 2019), even in the absence of overt standardization projects. In late 2019, I sat down for an interview with Gwee, a prominent public defender of Singlish. The lexical label �Singlish��a portmanteau of �Singapore(an)� and �English��indexes a shifty category (Fong, Lim, and Wee�2002), sometimes used for Singaporean Englishes broadly, other times for a particular basilectal variety in a Singaporean lectal continuum (Deterding�2007; Leimgruber�2012; M.-L. Ho and Platt�1993; Saraceni�2015; Wee�2018). The conversation that day covered a wide range of chronologically nonlinear ground, from details of Gwee�s linguistic biography as a Hokkien-Chinese Singaporean, to a Yahoo! TV web series he stars in, to his recent translation of Saint-Exup�ry�s 1943 classic�The Little Prince�into Singlish, to a 2016 incident that catapulted him into Singapore�s public-intellectual limelight, after an op-ed he published in defense of Singlish in the�New York Times�invited a published rebuttal by none other than the Singapore Prime Minister�s Press Secretary. Much of the early conversation focused on historical shifts in Singlish�s composition and sociolinguistic variation. It was relatively early in my fieldwork research, and I was still learning how to ask questions that did not reproduce hegemonic scripts (Carr�2009;�2010;�2011) about which other scholars have written extensively: scripts about Singlish as an existential threat to �Good English,� hence to Singapore�s economic competitiveness and geopolitical survival; scripts about Singlish as the most�even�the only��uniquely Singaporean� phenomenon, thus as worthy of celebration and commoditization (for an extended discussion of these scripts, see Wee�2018, Chapters 2 and 5). At this point, midway through the interview, I asked about a comment I had heard Gwee make during a public event a couple months prior, in which he speculated that Singlish seemed nowadays to be facing pressure toward standardization. Suddenly sitting forward in the chair, Gwee�s comportment became more agitated, his verbal pacing and prosodic range more exaggerated than before: The thing to remember about Singlish is that the words that came from Malay into Singlish came in pre-standardization. Back then, the Malay spelling was much more fluid. People were very tolerant about saying things different ways. It used to be that�o�and�u�were interchangeable. People used both, but it was no problem! Now, people don�t understand how things have changed in Malay. Now they say, �Oh, Chinese people are distorting the Malay language!� I followed up as soon as I had the opportunity: �May I ask, who is it who says that Chinese people are distorting the Malay language?� You�ll hear this a lot. People are always saying, �Don�t misspell it��especially about Malay words. The next stage in the battle is spelling. The thing is that, for most of the time Singlish was spoken, it was just oral. So, it didn�t matter, you just used the words. Now people are becoming more aware of the variety, they�re debating it more and more. But�you�don�t have to politicize it and make it about race like that. The emphasized �you� of the final sentence did not refer to me as the present addressee of the utterance, needless to say, but rather to a figure of personhood, a socially salient, differentiable kind of speaker-actor (Agha�2005;�2007): the critic who critiques a racially hegemonic other (Rosa and Flores�2017, 622) for acts of �distorting� the Malay language (and other minoritized codes) through misspelling, mispronunciation, or both. A few weeks later, I was sitting with a Singaporean Indian friend at an open-air kopitiam �coffee shop� in the east of Singapore, where we were passing the time before attending a performance. As we sat, a middle-aged Chinese Singaporean man approached the South Asian proprietor at a stall selling beverages and began loudly ordering. The increased volume and close proximity drew the attention of me and my friend, as well as several other bystanders; the conversation did not seem to be going smoothly, as the proprietor leaned in, brow furrowed, while the man doing the ordering continued to repeat himself. My friend rolled their eyes and directed their gaze toward me, lowering their voice: �Chinese people, right? They cannot pronounce Malay words properly! They like to pronounce like the words are Chinese but it�s�just�wrong.� I had been unable to overhear the content of the conversation, so I asked for clarification on what was being mispronounced. The response moved beyond the immediate interaction: �It�s every language that�s not Chinese, they just anyhow spell like they don�t care at all that we spell it�our�way.� (�Anyhow� in this usage can be glossed as �carelessly� or �in a haphazard manner�). This assertion was followed by several reported examples before the conversation moved on. Over the 12?months following this interview and conversation, I repeatedly encountered this figure: the critic who draws attention to both Singlish �errors,� and to the structural conditions that make those errors possible. I routinely encountered the earlier contrastive figure as well: the counter-critic, who�as voiced by Gwee�rejects the critic�s attempts to �politicize� Singlish and make �mere� facts of orthographic and phonetic variation �about race.� This article tracks the materialization of these two figures�the critic and the counter-critic�through a conjoined set of discourse registers. For individuals performing the figure of the counter-critic, sources were reframed as superfluous: what mattered was not how a word was used in the racialized �Mother Tongues� from which it was drawn, but how it came to habitually be used by �Singaporeans.� Performances of the critic, meanwhile, drew attention to token instances, or patterns of use, in which �Chinese Singaporeans� �got it wrong��and worse, defended their errors as actually correct vis-�-vis a generic figure of �the Singaporean.� I refer to the two contrastive positions respectively as�postracial policing�a strategy that indexes �the Singaporean� as the persona whose speech ought to be taken as the reference-point for �correct� Singlish�and��Mother Tongue� sourcing�a strategy that insists on fidelity to patterns-of-use embodied by (racialized) speakers of (racialized) �Mother Tongue� languages. In this article, I argue that, despite attempts to recruit Singlish to divergent ideological projects, these divergent projects co-participate in the construction of what I call an�image of standard. As I develop it here, the image of standard should be understood as a result of what Constantine Nakassis (2019) calls aesthetic textuality: a �principle for construing the sensuousness of semiosis� via �emergent structures of qualia[, materialized "
27,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA3 - 2015 - Tropes of Slang.txt," This article describes a class of speech varieties whose members have traditionally been called “slang” or “argot” in a large and long-standing literature. Despite the size of this literature, the characteristics of these speech varieties have remained obscure to those who purport to study them. The thing called “slang” has traditionally been reduced to the repertoires that count as samples of the thing without attention to either (a) the reflexive processes through which samples of the thing come to be differentiated from other discursive behaviors or (b) the social-interpersonal processes through which slang expressions undergo change in form and significance for different members of a language community. This article examines these reflexive social processes by considering examples from a large number of languages and historical periods. It offers a comparative framework for studying the forms of social life that such discursive behaviors enable or displace. Slang is an ideological framework for reasoning about language that defines a class of deviant registers of language. The ideology may exist with varying degrees of intensity, ubiquity, and institutionalized force within a language community. It is strengthened when a given speech variety comes increasingly to acquire the status of a baseline register, a standard in relation to which others are normatively evaluated as deviant or substandard. When a baseline standard is presumed as given, a relatively uniform set of metadiscursive criteria on norm and deviance become available as intuitions to persons exposed to standard-setting institutions. The more widely the standard is presupposed in diverse social practices, the more “natural” its metadiscursive criteria appear to language users and the more they draw attention to discourses that deviate from them. Under these conditions, the question “What is slang?” is often treated simply as a question about the characteristics of an object discourse, typically the words and utterances denoted by the term slang. The more the object discourse rises to salient attention, the easier it is to gather a large number of slang words and attempt to study their structural properties or to investigate their use in discourse and social interaction. Such a study reveals much about the characteristics of slang repertoires, as I show below, yet we cannot answer the question “What is slang?” by taking the repertoires of an object discourse as our point of departure, both for the general reasons that I have outlined elsewhere (Agha 1998; 2007a, 145–89), which ensure that repertoire-centric reductionism fails for every register formation in every known language, and for others that are more specific to the case of slang, as I now show. The incompleteness of a repertoire perspective is painfully obvious and its reasons are well known. Slang repertoires exhibit changes that cannot be explained simply by appeal to structural property of slang words. Slang is “passing language” (to use a nineteenth-century term) in more than one sense. Expressions fall into and out of current slang usage with great rapidity. Many expressions also cross repertoire boundaries over time so that expressions that began as slang contractions (e.g., English phone, bike, pub, bus) often find their way into the standard language, sometimes even replacing the terms from which they were derived (cf. bus vs. autobus). A repertoire-centric approach is therefore quite unrevealing about the nature of slang as a social formation. It is also incomplete as a method of analysis since slang expressions are not differentiable from the rest of the language without using native metapragmatic judgments of norm and deviance as data on identification. These data are not to be found in slang expressions but in discursive and other metasemiotic activities that differentiate such expressions from others and typify their social indexical values, and, once analyzed as data, clarify whether and for which groups (and in which period) some expressions have happened to count or do still count as slang expressions, thus differentiating group-centric positionalities of social evaluation. Although the term slang describes speech repertoires, its usage indexes relationships between social groups. To say that some utterance is slang, or contains a slang expression, is to inhabit a metapragmatic stance that evaluates its speaker as deviating from a presumed standard. Such a stance may or may not correspond to social regularities of evaluation. In its least constrained usage the term slang may be employed as a term of open pejoration for virtually any form of speech simply in order to dismiss it. I am not concerned with such cases here. My concern rather is with cases where one person’s judgment that an utterance is slang is replicable in the metapragmatic judgments of other speakers. Under these conditions, any metadiscursive use of the term slang locates its speaker in an ideological framework for reasoning about register varieties where the relationship between standard and deviant object discourses defines group-centric social relationships among their speakers. By “tropes of slang” I refer to the class of (meta)semiotic processes described below whereby speech repertoires come to be evaluated as deviant with respect to one or more presupposed standards when brought under slang formulations, including cases where underlying criteria are not readily described by the evaluators who employ them and cases where speech habits perceived as deviant by one subgroup are renormalized in the speech of others, who invest these forms with distinct indexical values. The dialectic of norm and trope (Agha 2007a, 5–9), which I explore for the cases at hand, has nothing in particular to do with slang, of course, but is a pervasive feature of all social life insofar as it is organized by semiotic processes and, through its representative moments (the normalization of cultural models of conduct, the manipulation of models through tropic variants, the renormalization of tropes for distinct social domains of evaluators), is a ubiquitous principle of cultural variation and group differentiation, regardless of which rubric—such as deference (Agha 2007a, 295–339), kinship (Agha 2007a, 340–85), or brands (Agha 2015)—these semiotic processes may be grouped under within folk taxonomies. My goal here is to attend to its role in discursive practices that are commonly thought to include samples of so-called slang. The most obvious of such tropes is the trope of personification. If we attend to the data of metapragmatic judgments we find that expressions that are enregistered as slang repertoires are routinely described by means of words predicable of persons, including adjectives that describe characterological attributes (e.g., casual, informal, crude, cool) or modifiers that assign slang repertoires to social categories (e.g., teenage slang, doctor’s slang, military slang). Ideologies of slang typically convert slang repertoires into systems of stereotypical social indexicals whereby particular kinds of social personae are linked to—and thus can be inhabited and negotiated through the use of—slang expressions, including personae emblematic of membership in or exclusion from specific social groups. Though seemingly simple, the production of personae is a highly laminated trope and bespeaks changing relations between groups, as we shall soon see. Therefore slang is used in this article not simply as the name of a speech variety but as a term whose usage indexes relationships between discourses and their speakers. This issue becomes especially important when we turn in the last section to discourses of a type that were once called slang but are now given entirely distinct metadiscursive and characterological formulations by their own speakers, and the mainstream term slang becomes increasingly irrelevant to grasping the social indexical effects mediated by their use. Slang and Its Analogues The term slang has itself meant different things in different historical periods and, given the difficulty its proponents have faced in defining it, has come to be grouped under more encompassing rubrics, such as “slang and its analogues.”1 I use this phrase to introduce the generic phenomenon here, but my goal is to decompose its denotata into their semiotic partials and to outline the metadiscursive processes through which they become grouped under this rubric. These processes are far more interesting than the labels under which they have been aggregated and, once understood, transform questions like “What is slang?” from questions about speech repertoires to questions about (meta)discursively mediated relations among social groups. A curious feature of the cultural construct is that in periods in which the term is in common use, and especially in the second half of the twentieth century a great many speakers were wedded to a particular picture of what slang really is and, often, to a fiercely committed judgment on its value. Since slang registers have been derided by mainstream discourses for so long, a common—and laudable—goal of recent work has been to show that they are merely functionally differentiated registers within languages, which, like other registers, serve complex and important social functions in the contexts in which they are used. Yet both kinds of stances—positions that are “for” slang and those “against” it—have always been inhabitable positions on the cultural formation. We merely happen to live in a period where cultural metadiscourses that evaluate some (but not all) slang varieties in positive terms have become relatively more institutionalized than they once were. For example, American youth slang is nowadays part of global mediatized processes (e.g., pop music, movies, television, travel, and tourism) that make particular expressions of the variety very widely known. It is not difficult today to find speakers of Japanese, Thai, or Bengali who employ fragments of American youth slang even though they do not speak English fluently. Although youth slangs appear to exist independently of each other in most, if not all, societies, it may well be that global processes of these kinds are transforming regional varieties of youth slang into generic emblems of “cool” that, despite local differences, have translocal properties as well. Yet, contemporary enthusiasms about youth slang aside, we cannot understand the general characteristics of slang ideologies and practices by taking youth slang (or, even less so, contemporary American youth slang) as our point of departure. We need a wider empirical base. Historically, the term slang has been used in a much broader sense than is commonplace today, a usage that includes not only age-graded slangs but also slangs associated with particular social classes and professions, as well as specialized registers used—or believed to be used—by members of criminal professions; for this last subclass of slang varieties, the terms cant and argot are also used. Table 1 lists some of the more specific register names that have been used for slang in this broad sense. Table 1. Metadiscursive Terms for Slang and Its Analogues Age, class, or professional types of slang Underworld slangs (cant, criminal argot) Teenage slang Whiz mob (United States) Zuñi youth slang Pickpocket argot (United States) American college slang Shelta (Ireland) Cockney rhyming slang Grypserka (Polish prisons) Victorian upper-class slang Pelting speech (Elizabethan England) American medical slang Panda argot (Benares, India) Legal slang Dalaalii bolii (Benares, India) Cowboy slang (or lingo) UlTii (Calcutta) The speech varieties that have historically been viewed—or are viewed today—as slang are by no means identical to each other. They differ enormously in their users; in the settings of their appropriate use; in the languages within which they are functionally differentiated as registers; and in the historical relations between users of the slang and other speakers of the language. But they share certain features too. Varieties that are treated as slang within a language do not themselves comprise a discrete “language,” whether in the sense of having a wholly distinct phonology and morphosyntax, of possessing distinct vocabulary items for every term lexicalized in the source language, or of being the only speech variety used by a community. Slang vocabularies typically exist as functionally differentiated registers within the total repertoires of a language, and their own repertories tend to belong to highly restricted lexical domains (primarily words denoting persons and their activities). Moreover, no one who uses slang uses it all the time; to know a slang is to know that it is appropriate only to certain occasions. In this sense slang is a contextual register of speech, and, like every other register, effective competence in the register includes knowledge of when not to use it.2 When the register characteristics of slang are not recognized, tropes of slang are readily reified. For instance, Halliday (1976) classifies argotic varieties of slang as “anti-languages,” arguing that it is their “metaphorical character” that constitutes them as such. But since no slang is a “language” unto itself but rather a contextually specific register fraction of a language, no slang is an anti-“language,” except in a metaphorical sense. And Halliday’s view that argotic varieties reflect an “anti-reality” or that their usage constitutes an “anti-society” implies that to switch contextually between registers of a language is to switch between realities and societies. Once we see that slang formations are definable only through relationships between metadiscourses and object discourses, it is possible to see that the tropic qualities of slang depend on both features of metadiscourses and of object discourses, including tropes performed through each, which exhibit substantial variation. Even the perception that slang usage indexes deviant social personae has several distinct sources. One of these is the fact that slang is definable only as a value boundary phenomenon. Slang as a Value-Boundary Phenomenon Although slang is inherently value-laden, its social value is articulated in different ways from different social positions. In the case of age-graded slangs, for instance, different value judgments can typically be obtained at different points in a person’s life cycle: in many societies, persons who, when young, employ slang terminologies in in-group usage tend as they grow older to come to take a dim view of slang. To speak of the “social values” of enactable signs is simply to note that certain social regularities of metapragmatic evaluation can be observed and documented as data. Any act of evaluating the social values of a speech repertoire is an act in which the evaluator formulates an interactional position (for self) vis-à-vis the repertoire evaluated (and its users). Hence to say that the values of slang repertoires differ by social position is always to speak of interactionally projected acts of self (vs. other) positioning.3 The interesting thing about slang (and its analogues) is that slang repertoires are not simply register fractions of a language; they invariably exist at a value boundary. The notion can be defined as follows: a register exists at a “value boundary” if it (1) is negatively valorized by at least one set of metapragmatic evaluators and (2) is positively evaluated by at least one (other) group of evaluators. We know that many, if not all, register systems tend to involve value boundaries in this sense. But for very hegemonic kinds of registers, such as the standard language, negatively valorizing discourses often have a marginal status. Thus one can go about investigating all kinds of properties of a standard language without worrying about countervalorizations or even noticing that the object under analysis is, in fact, a register linked to a value system. Slang is the very opposite. Our initial encounters with slang are almost invariably encounters with a value boundary phenomenon. Although most registers empirically turn out to involve value boundaries of a more or less salient kind, slang registers can be identified only at a value boundary. For every slang, both negative and positive evaluations are routinely produced, though not generally by the same evaluators. The idea that slang is substandard or vulgar is itself a negative evaluation. Such metapragmatic evaluations are ubiquitous today. They are institutionalized in standard-oriented and standard-replicating practices, such as lexicography and schooling. The ability to differentiate a slang from the rest of the language depends on negative valorizations that are articulated by such practices and recycled in the intuitions of those exposed to them. But encounters with slang varieties thus identified are also encounters with positive evaluations of speech. Nothing functions as a slang unless it is used. For any living slang—one that exists as a functioning variety for some users—we can invariably find occasions where the use of slang expressions is ratified by interlocutors as appropriate to the current interactional frame. Such responses are implicit metapragmatic evaluations that typify a slang usage as appropriate to its context but do not describe what they typify (Agha 2007a, 150–54). When a slang variety continues to be used by a subgroup—despite its negative valorization by mainstream institutions—the “routinization of ratified use” in in-group speech constitutes a social regularity of positive evaluation. In some cases competing valorizations are centered in the habits of specific demographic groups. For instance, teachers and parents often characterize contemporary youth slang as a form of cognitive impairment, for example, as something that “robs our children of the ability to think clearly.” When such negative assessments are encountered by the slang’s speakers as emanating from a group other than their own, the activity of using the slang is often valorized as an emblem of self-differentiation (against the first group) and of in-group identity among its users (in the second). And in many contemporary cases, the speech variety in question comes to be repossessed by its users under metapragmatic descriptions that do not employ the word slang. But why does slang involve a value boundary? The Voicing Structure of Slang Metadiscourses The word slang is not a slang word. It is a word of Standard English. The lexeme does not belong to the deviant register that it names. Hence to employ the term descriptively is to use one register to characterize another and thus to inhabit a register boundary in the act of description. In particular, such a usage is voiced from the perspective of the standard. It is useful to locate such tropes within a larger context of metapragmatic tropes mediated by names for speech varieties. All of the terms listed in Table 2 are Standard English words. But whereas the terms in column 1 are usable without register breach when the speech variety they name is being used, the terms in columns 2 and 3 are not usable in this way. Thus, the term sports commentary can readily occur in a televised sports broadcast. But psychobabble is not a term used in psychobabble, and legalese does not belong to legal register. Switching registers in moments of metadiscursive typification often yields forms of contrastive footing. A lawyer cannot characterize his own closing argument as legalese without self-disparagement, but using the term to impugn the opposing counsel’s arguments is good strategy. Although a great variety of interactional tropes can be achieved by using the terms in columns 2 and 3, all of these effects depend in part on the fact that to utter them is to use one register to characterize another and, thus, to inhabit a register boundary through the act of usage. Table 2. Register Membership and Personification in Metadiscursive Terminologies (1) (2) (3) Sports commentary Slang Medicalese Church service Jargon Legalese School lesson Argot Bureaucratese Standard English Cant Psychobabble Some of these terms personify speech in an explicit way. The terms in column 3 are formed by adding a metalinguistic suffix (-ese, -babble) to a term associated with a category of person. The derivational suffix –ese productively takes as its stem a role designating noun (bureaucrat-) or an adjective (legal-, medical-) that describes practices associated with a social role; and the derived term transparently denotes the social role category whose speech it mocks. The terms in column 2 are, by contrast, lexically nonspecific in their personifications. Yet compound expressions, or phrases derived from them, such as those listed in Table 1, readily link them to specific social personae. Let us now focus on the term slang in particular: It does not belong to the register it names. And it does not lexically name the kind of person who uses it. Yet the denotation of the term is not specified solely by its lexical form. The term slang routinely occurs in discourses that personify slang varieties in explicit and specific ways. Whenever a person-designating expression occurs as a modifier to the noun slang, the noun phrase as a whole personifies a speech variety. Thus to speak of lawyers’ slang, college slang, or thieves’ slang is to use a noun phrase that describes an apparently bounded speech variety, whose boundary is specified by naming its speaker. And although the term slang formulates speech and speakers as deviant in some way, the description as a whole is voiced from the standpoint of the standard language. Such standard-voiced formulations of deviance are commonly read backwards as etymologies of the word form itself.4 The association of slang with “thieves and vagabonds” is attested in dictionary entries from relatively early on and is perhaps recycled into popular imaginaries through them.5 Metadiscursive Genres There are many genres of slang metadiscourse (whether popular or authoritative, print mediated or electronic) that circulate representations of specific speech varieties in public life. Some of these employ the term slang to characterize repertoires and speakers, explicitly drawing social-characterological boundaries around facts of speech variation. Others merely embed slang expressions into discursive activities that are not officially about slang (e.g., movies, advertisements, humor) but that nonetheless deploy slang stereotypes in more implicit ways; the recognizability of criterial personae by audiences is often a condition on the success of these projects. This is especially important in the commercial sector where the marketing of products strategically relies on the ability of target audiences to identify with social personae that can be inhabited ever more fully through the acquisition of product emblems (Agha 2011). Metadiscourses that typify slang by using the word slang differ sharply from more implicit patterns of metapragmatic typification, as in the case of utterances that merely respond to a usage as if it were substandard or deviant in some way, or utterances that evidence evaluative awareness of a register contrast in responding to a specific pattern of slang usage by switching to a reciprocal slang response. These patterns of metapragmatic typification tend also to differ by discourse genre. For example, the term slang shows up commonly in metadiscursive practices that prescribe the use of Standard English by proscribing another usage as slang. But the word slang shows up rarely, if ever, in discourses that employ slang expressions to sell commercial products (such as branded automobiles like the Kia Sportage®) or in discursive interactions where patterns of reciprocal slang usage effectively serve to maintain the in-group identities of interlocutors. Slang is not a discrete or unitary phenomenon at either the object-discursive level (since its repertoires change rapidly) or the metadiscursive level (since its social life is shaped by competing valorizations), but particular forms of slang do acquire a certain specificity at the intersection of these levels. Our folk sense that we are dealing with a bounded phenomenon derives from the fact that when we think of slang, or encounter a slang usage, we are faced with a speech repertoire whose values are given by specific metapragmatic judgments, often ones that are socially inculcated in us as habits of evaluation by institutional discourses of different kinds. Although such lines are invariably drawn in sand, they are sometimes reinforced by sand castles, as one example should make clear. Drawing Boundaries by Invoking Standards Although the semantic range of the term slang has expanded and contracted in various ways over the last two centuries, one feature that remains constant is the perception that it names a substandard variety. But which standard do slang varieties deviate from? Since the 1850s the development of the register we now call Standard English has, of course, provided a common baseline of evaluation. The fact that Standard English is itself a historically varying register—linked to slang, for example, by patterns of word borrowing in both directions—is worth noting, but this issue is not itself to the point since Standard English is not the only baseline standard used to reckon the deviance of slang. It is rather the perception that some unified standard exists that is critical to the pejorative treatment of slang repertoires and speakers. Of course, the perception that a standard exists is merely the presupposition that at least one standard exists. But different standards have, in fact, been invoked at different times, and some of these invocations are themselves part of an effort to construct new standards or to expand the social domain of incipient ones. Thus, Morris Fishbein, the editor of the American Medical Association’s journal, writes in the 1930s: (1) Many words have found their way into medical vocabularies with unusual meanings that are not recognized even by medical dictionaries. Such writings may be characterized as medical jargon or medical slang … they … are the mark of the careless and uncultured person.” (1938, 47) The appeal to “medical dictionaries” is an appeal not to Standard English but to the standard register of medicine, or Medical Standard (capital M, capital S); and the phrase “careless and uncultured person” is one among many he uses to describe those who use medical slang. According to Fishbein, postmortem is medical slang, autopsy is Medical Standard; diabetic is medical slang, person with diabetes is Medical Standard; epileptic is medical slang, person with epilepsy is Medical Standard. In his role as editor, he then legislates: “In the publications of the American Medical Association such usages are banned” (49). I noted earlier that slang expressions routinely cross register boundaries sometimes even replacing the terms with which they once contrasted as slang. Although most of the words that Fishbein once banned—postmortem, diabetic, epileptic, and many others—have now become Medical Standard and no longer count as slang, the boundary between the standard and its slang still exists, and new forms of medical slang emerge routinely in the speech of doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel. Gordon (1983) cites a number of such expressions, including beached whale ‘an obese patient’, gomer ‘alcoholic, unkempt, derelict’, crock ‘patient who constantly complains, but has no disease’, crick ‘a crock who turns out in the end to have a legitimate disease’. And, as with all slang registers, such expressions are treated as appropriate only to certain participation frameworks. They do not occur in the presence of patients or senior doctors, but are common in the banter of younger medical personnel during coffee breaks or chance meetings in corridors and elevators. Interactional Microspaces In large standard-language communities many slang varieties coexist as functionally differentiated registers within the same language. The social domain in which any given slang register effectively functions in communication corresponds to the class of persons competent in its use. Partridge (1933) describes twenty-five varieties of slang used in British English in the first quarter of the twentieth century. These include slangs used by Cockney speakers, workmen, tradesmen, journalists, lawyers, doctors, publishers, literary critics, sailors, soldiers, and many others. If his descriptions are accurate we may assume that these varieties were prototypically centered in at least these social domains: although some expressions in each variety were evidently known more widely as well, most expressions were commonly used and understood only by members of these social groups. Cases of this kind suggest that large standard language communities are characterized by massive society-internal register differentiation through the ideological framework of slang. Many kinds of slang coexist with each other within a language community and define many microspaces of interaction linked to specific social practices and groups. Such microspaces are not hermetically sealed off against each other, of course, given the fact that some slang expressions are recycled through diverse metadiscursive practices—including, today, television, internet, movies and other mass media—from one social domain to others, often yielding forms of fragmentary circulation (Agha 2007a, 165–67) of speech forms and of intuitions about them, whether across locales (including national boundaries) or across demographic profiles (scholars vs. the people they study). Nonetheless, from the standpoint of fluency or authentic proficiency, the zoning of slang varieties into interactional microspaces ensures asymmetries of effective competence within a language community: All fluent speakers of a language are not fully competent in any one of its slang varieties. Although each variety called slang presupposes a baseline standard, the baseline may differ for different ones. The fact that every baseline is itself a historically varying register need not interfere with the fact that slang utterances effectively mediate forms of interpersonal footing in microspaces of social interaction among those who recognize them as slang. But shifting baselines do proliferate slang varieties. Partridge (1933) observes that every class has its slang. This is an accurate use of the bare lexeme slang. The presupposition that a standard exists can be used to formulate negative judgments both within and across group boundaries. In the former case, the judgment often re-partitions the group around facts of language use, implicitly contrasting a subgroup that upholds its standard with one that does not. In the latter case, the speech of another class is handy in stigmata of downward or upward mobility, organizing behaviors and aspirations within the group. But the process is indexically open: the unmodified use of the term slang implies no specific sociological boundary. And since class-specific slangs change generationally, the bare lexeme slang operates as a cultural shifter of a rather specific kind: When its usage formulates some speech variety as nonstandard, the act (1) presupposes the existence of some (at least one) standard, though different ones may be relevant to different microspaces of interaction, and (2) entails a reclassification of speech and speakers, which, over historical time, may re-partition social groups successively and iteratively, giving subgroups and stigmata new social lives in the eyes and ears of those who recognize them. Tropic Features of Slang Lexemes The repertoires of slang include lexical items but also prosodic, syntactic and other features of “speech style.” Although slang is therefore typically an enregistered style of conduct (Agha 2007a, 185–88), its lexical features constitute the most transparent (easily reportable) subset of its stylistic repertoires. Popular metadiscourses about slang give disproportionate attention to its lexical repertoires, treating them—through a metonymic reduction—as the slang itself, thereby reformulating slang as a lexical register of the language. Slang expressions include lexemes of varying degrees of complexity—including fixed phrases, idioms and other holophrastic lexations. Once we examine the internal structure of these lexemes it is evident that the lexical register of slang consists of a system of lexicalized tropes that appear fractionally to deviate from the standard presupposed as relevant in the instance. Slang is both familiar and strange to the standard ear, a fact on which its ironic force depends. Table 3 illustrates the lexical repertoires associated with a few of the slang registers listed in Table 1. Each table panel (1–6) presents lexical data on register contrasts in the usual tabular display. Such a display employs three kinds of discursive data, which I have distinguished here by means of CAPS, italics, and roman typeface. Listed at the top of each panel is a metadiscursive characterization of the speech variety. Each such characterization specifies a chronotopic boundary of usage (Agha 2007b), implying a specific type of user and/or locale (thieves, British person, college student, etc.) and a period in which the register was in common use (seventeenth century, nineteenth century, etc.). The italicized forms on the left are the lexical items of the register in question. The forms on the right are corresponding “standard” expressions. Table 3.

If we consider the nature of the correspondence between slang and standard expressions in each row of Table 3, it is readily apparent that we are dealing with partial correspondences in each case. A partial correspondence involves a structural analogue or calque along some dimension of lexical organization but not others, an issue to which I return below. Each italicized expression on the left corresponds fractionally to the standard expression on the right, and (from the perspective of the standard) is therefore fractionally deviant. This fractional congruence is due to various types of lexicogrammatical tropism across register boundaries, such as blends (buel / body + fuel, in panel 6), aphaeresis (word-initial omission: aagun / gun, in panel 3), metathesis (chaam/maach, in panel 3), lexical hypertrophy (the eleven words for vagabond in panel 4), hyponymy (bod ‘a (person’s) body’ in panel 6), and so on. Before we proceed to a discussion of such cases it is vital to see that fractional congruence of lexical items across register boundaries differentiates lexical registers only under certain conditions. These conditions are met in naturally occurring slangs, but not in artificial slangs derived from simple rule-governed word games. Partial Lexicalization and Register Breach: Textual Foregrounding of Deviance For the artificial slangs shown in (2), slang expressions are formed by simple rules that are highly productive in the sense that they can be applied to every word in the language. (2) Slangs based on simple, productive rules (Crystal 1987, 59): (a) English back slang: inversion of letters yielding “backward” pronunciation kew = week; neetrith = thirteen; tekram = market (b) French parler a l’envers ‘speaking backwards’: inversion of syllables painsco = copains ‘friends’; rima = mari ‘husband’; verlen = l’envers ‘backwards’ (c) English Pig Latin: fronting of initial consonant to word-final position, followed by an ay or e Utpay = put; Utpay atthay okkbay ownday = Put that book down. Thus a back slang is formed by a rule of inversion, yielding words that are pronounced “backwards” in relation to the standard language. In a variety used by English soldiers in the First World War what is inverted is the letters of the written word, as shown in (2a). In the French variety of back slang in (2b), what is inverted is the order of syllables. Pig Latin in (2c) involves consonant fronting plus vowel addition. In these cases rules of word formation like inversion, consonant movement and vowel addition are used to create deviant lexemes from the materials of the standard language. But the rules that yield structural calques are very simple and regular. The standard lexeme is predictable from the slang form if you know the rule. There is no need to learn a separate vocabulary and, since rules of word formation apply productively across word classes, every lexical item in an utterance can be a slang expression (e.g., Pig Latin “Utpay atthay okkbay ownday” [Put that book down]). In such cases, slang expressions and nonslang source expressions do exhibit structural calques, but insofar as the rules that map the latter onto the former are simple and universally productive across every syllable and word class, slang utterances can readily consist wholly of slang expressions, and no utterance-internal indexical noncongruence typically results in the speech of proficient speakers. Only when you combine multiple principles of structural calquing and relax the condition that they apply regularly across the entire lexicon, as is the case for naturally occurring slangs, do structural calques yield utterance-internal forms of “deviance.” In the case of naturally occurring slangs (such as the ones in Table 3 above), only a small subset of the standard vocabulary has slang alternants, and these can occur only in a narrow range of grammatical slots in slang utterances. In most cases, the majority of slang expressions are lexicalized as nouns, adjectives and verbs, with few or none occurring in other grammatical classes. Partial lexicalization entails that slang lexemes occur as foregrounded segments in discourse. This is illustrated for American College Slang in (3): (3) Natural slangs: Partial lexicalization and register breach (Eble 1996): (a) The doper music is loud tonight. (b) Question: “How’s the weather?” Answer: “Rainage.” (c) That guy has one killer jump shot. (d) Don’t read that book—it’s a real wanker. (e) My parents didn’t come through with fundage. In such cases, slang expressions occur in bounded regions of discursive text, as text-segments whose surrounding material is not slang. It is therefore not possible to use slang expressions without the accompaniment of nonslang expressions in the same utterance, and hence, not possible to use the slang register without register breach in the sense discussed above. Partial lexicalization thus sets a limit on slang as a speech style: Slang utterances are internally noncohesive by register criteria. They consist of contiguous text-segments that belong to different registers. The standard language also involves a distinctive lexical register, of course, but its register includes lexemes of every grammatical category. This is no accident or happenstance; it is a systematic feature of how standard registers are formulated by metadiscursive institutions. Hence it is possible to construct long chunks of Standard discourse without register breach. By contrast, the pervasiveness of register breach within slang utterances foregrounds the perception of utterance-internal “deviation” whenever these utterances are encountered by Standard speakers. It is also worth noting that when the language games in (2) are transformed into group differentiating slang varieties, they are also converted into registers that exhibit partial lexicalization (in repertoires) and register breach (in usage). Thus Verlan is a slang register that is derived from parler l’envers and therefore exhibits the forms of syllable inversion characteristic of the source language game in (2b)—indeed, the term Verlan is itself an inversion of l’envers—but which, today, is no longer comprehensible to “noninitiates” due to a number of additional features, such as the unpredictable alteration of medial vowels and word truncation in many Verlan words, and, even more effectively, due to extensive forms of word borrowing—whether from languages spoken by minorities in France, such as Arabic, Wolof, and Portuguese, or the recycling of archaic French slang into contemporary Verlan—and the subsequent transformation of many borrowed words through syllable inversion. And prosodic features (which have nothing to do with syllable inversion) mark Verlan as distinct from French too. At the same time, many words that occur in Verlan utterances are not distinct from Standard French at all, thus linking partial lexicalization to register breach in multiple ways at the level of utterances (Doran 2004, 96–99). Yet this is not the only way in which the object discourses of slang appear deviant. Whereas slang utterances exhibit deviation through register breach (due to co-occurrence of slang and nonslang expressions), slang lexemes themselves appear deviant to the standard ear too, but for an entirely distinct reason. Cross-Repertoire Tropes At the level of lexical repertoires, the perception of deviation is an effect of structural calques between lexemes belonging to distinct registers. Two items belonging to different registers are structural calques if they exhibit a partial formal analogy along some (at least one) dimension of phono-lexico-grammatical organization. Their partial likeness is notionally grasped as a similarity of denotational content, and their dissimilarity is often described in contrastive personifications of their speakers. In (4), Erich, a high school student is comparing two lexical items—kick back and relax. The two are partially analogous in structural sense (Agha 2007a, 112–15)—both are intransitive verbs, both take animate subjects, and both are near antonyms of work hard—but they differ in phonolexical form. Erich describes this partial sense equivalence as a similarity of “ideas”—as how the idea behind one “fits” the idea behind the other—but he personifies the difference between them as a difference of speaker type, treating relax as the “normal” term that he—as a presumably normal person—prefers: (4) From partial congruence to persona differentiation (Bucholtz 2001, 90) Erich: The idea behind the term fits but the term itself doesn’t—isn’t the way I prefer it to be. Like “kick back.” I just prefer something—some normal term. … Like “to relax” … something like that. Slang lexemes are typically structural calques or partial analogues of standard lexemes, making slang both familiar and strange to the standard ear. But most speakers cannot readily describe the nature of these structural calques and, instead, personify the difference, as Erich does, thereby transforming facts of morphosyntactic or phonolexical difference into facts of sociological difference. Most slang items permit multiple analogies to words of the standard. Thus the slang term blurb not only exhibits a phonological analogy to words like blunt and curb—to bl(unt) at syllable onset, to (cu)rb at syllable coda, and to both in the vowel at syllable peak—it also occurs as a direct object of the verb read and, hence, is a syntactic analogue of words like book, magazine, bible, pamphlet, and so on. Such multiple analogies are possible because every word has a hierarchical constituency with respect to grammar—concurrently manifesting phonemic, syllabic, morphemic, and phrasal constituency—any of which may be analogous across the register boundary as others differ. Slang words like scoopage, fundage, rainage, and foodage exhibit partial analogies to standard words like postage, both phonologically and morphologically (in the last syllable). The morphological analogy obscures a disanalogy, however, since the suffix –age is overgeneralized in the slang, yielding an expanded set of base stems (including scoop-, fund-, rain- and food-) in the slang variety, but not in the standard. (Other Standard English lexemes, like voyage and suffrage are also vaguely reminiscent of the slang set, but they are no longer analyzable as having a segmentable suffix –age, and therefore less transparent as calques.) Given the fact that any given slang expression has all of these kinds of structure—phonological, morphological, syntactic—the hierarchical constituency of the word ensures that many kinds of partial analogies are implemented concurrently. Comparability along one dimension, but noncomparability along others yields a denotationally tropic effect in discourse. Thus scoopage is a morpholexical calque of postage due to identity of suffix, and also because both verb stems, scoop- and post-, take inanimate direct objects. Yet when the American College slang lexeme scoopage is used for “sexually desirable persons” (as in “Is Joe scoopage?”) a person is tropically formulated as an inanimate object, as a thing that can be scooped up (or out) when used as an instrument of gratification. In (5), the cross-repertoire trope depends on overgeneralization. For instance, beam out is an animate subject verb, and thus comparable to walk out. Although the class of slang expressions in (5a)—beam out, goob out, and so on—is based on derivational processes that are familiar when they apply to verbs like walk (yielding walk out in Standard English), the class is formed by overgeneralization to words that are either not verbs or not recognizable as standard words (goob, phase, spaz, z). Similarly, the –er in American College slang in (5b) forms words through overgeneralization from Standard English (where transitive agentive verbs, like paint, yield agentive nouns, like painter) to a miscellany of expressions (including dope and wank, which yield a miscellany of derived forms, whether noun or adjective, whether animate/agentive or not) in the slang register. This particular -er formant is comparable to the nineteenth-century Oxford -er (in Table 3, panel 5), though patterns of word truncation and overgeneralization are different. (5) Overgeneralization: Standard English American College Slang (a) walk out beam out ‘daydream’ goob out ‘cause repulsion or disgust’ phase out ‘become unaware, as if asleep’ spaz out ‘lose mental control’ z out ‘go to sleep’ (b) paint-er bummer ‘that which bums one out’ crasher ‘one who cannot tolerate alcohol’ doper ‘associated with marijuana smokers’ cruiser ‘one who seeks the opposite sex’ killer ‘excellent, desirable’ wanker ‘undesirable person, thing or situation In (6), we see syntactic analogues. Although none of the expressions in the slang column (butthead, twerp, yo-yo, etc.) are semantically equivalent to the Standard English lexeme person, they are all nonetheless syntactico-semantic analogues. Expressions in both columns occur in grammatical constructions that are criterial for the class of [+human] nouns in English—they all permit equational predication with human nouns (“Joe is a real X”), they all occur as subjects of verba sentiendi (“The X {saw me/read the newspaper}”), and all permit resumptive anaphoric reference with him/her—but only one of the items, the form person, belongs to the standard register; all the others are slang. Under these conditions, one lexical item in Standard English has many analogues in slang, and, quite apart from the trope of lexical hypertrophy, all the slang lexemes appear to depersonify or repersonify their referent in some way. (6) Lexicosyntactic analogues Standard English Slang ‘person’ butthead, twerp, yo-yo, cretin, crud, dimwit, dingleberry, dip, dork, donut hole, geek, groover, gweeb, jerk face, nob, punk, quimp, reeb, scazbag, tang, tool, three dollar bill, cracker jack, twink, ween, wimp, wuss Such examples can be multiplied without limit for every slang variety ever described. But the phenomenon of cross-repertoire tropism is common to all cases. Grammatical calques invest lexical contrasts across register boundaries with forms of partial likeness that are tropically organized across several concurrent dimensions of grammatical organization. But these partial analogies are not readily described by language users because they involve multiple, lexemically intersecting “covert” categories (Whorf 1956) of structural sense, and the fractional noncongruence of structural sense dimensions among utterance segments is routinely personified instead as a social-characterological difference among those whose utterances these are, their speakers. A metaphysics of personified social difference, often viewed as differentiating characterological “essences” among persons, readily emerges as a Whorfian “fashion of speaking” in such cases, thus converting and reanalyzing differences configured by one semiotic principle (structural sense) into differences that effectively constitute a semiotic principle of an altogether distinct kind (group differentiation). When Slang Becomes Irrelevant to Slang I observed earlier that slang is not a unitary phenomenon at either the metadiscursive or object discursive levels and I have observed that distinct forms of “deviance” emerge from tropes at both levels. Tropes involving personification, metonymic reduction, or value boundaries primarily involve metadiscursive practices of language users. And tropes involving register breach and repertoire calques draw attention to utterances and repertoires of the object discourse. And it should be evident that, despite the analytical usefulness of distinguishing these two levels, tropic formulations of both kinds are recursively embedded in each other and stacked within utterance segments when persons inhabit footings with each other through slang formations. It is therefore unsurprising that many registers whose object discourses are of the type traditionally called slang are formulated today as registers of an entirely different kind by metadiscourses produced by their speakers and by analogues recycled in the mass media. The Indonesian slang register called Bahasa Gaul (Smith-Hefner 2007) exhibits all of the features characteristic of slang object discourses: cross-repertoire tropes based on grammatical calques and word borrowings from a large number of source registers (including English, as well as Indonesian criminal argots). Mainstream metapragmatic discourses characterize it as a slang linked to linguistic and mental corruption in the usual way. But the metapragmatic discourses of its young users treat the register as an emblem of egalitarianism and generational distinction from older speakers and, through its links to urban Jakarta, as an emblem of cosmopolitanism and upward social mobility. A growing number of self-help books targeted to young populations have appeared in recent years, and even young Muslim preachers, although linked to the conservatism of an ongoing Islamic resurgence, have begun to pepper their speech with Gaul in order to bring young television audiences into the sphere of religious propriety. Gaul is now well on its way to middle-class respectability, though it is still indexical of “cool” and trendy personae, and its usage remains susceptible to metapragmatic evaluations of brashness, overfamiliarity, and rudeness. In the case of the Nouchi register used by young people in Côte d’Ivoire (Newell 2009), the indexical revalorization of the register also depends on recursive embedding of meta- and object discourses, though the discourses are entirely different. In a context where the Ivorian state has long promoted a purist version of French as an emblem of national modernity, Nouchi provides a contrastive emblem of autochthonous modernity to its users. Although it draws on an obscure criminal argot, also called Nouchi, the modern slang register of Nouchi draws on other source registers, such as Dioula, associated with translocal trade, and also English. Yet its syntactic patterns remain entirely those of French. It therefore contrasts with pure French as an autochthonous “popular French” to some degree, though it also recalls translocal figurements of speaker persona as well. Changes in the register’s indexical values are also linked to changes in its social domain and social range (Agha 2007a, 169): Through its appropriation by university students and its recycling in mass media, Nouchi is now exported overseas through musical genres and other cultural products; and, as it becomes increasingly the primary register used in public settings by those between ages 10 and 30, it is coming to be evaluated much less as a slang, as classically understood, than as an emblem of an emerging national identity. The case of Indonesian Bahasa Gay (Boellstorff 2004) is somewhat analogous. Although used by gay and lesbian persons as an emblem of homosexual identity, and still treated as a “secret” gay language by many mainstream discourses, Bahasa Gay is not known to, or spoken by, all gay persons; and it is not generally semantically opaque when used because its lexemes typically occur in discursive cotextual frames where most surrounding material is standard Indonesian; and, through its recycling in mass media, its elements are increasingly appropriated by nongay Indonesians as a vernacular emblem of translocal national belonging. The Gothic/Lolita speech registers used by young Japanese women (Gagné 2008)—whose linguistic forms are clearly deviant in relation to standard Japanese and which clearly exist at a value boundary within Japanese society—are merely fragments of commodity registers (Agha 2011), where speech is deployed along with sartorial styles—including corsets, bonnets, long one-piece dresses, and parasols—which together constitute a multi-channel sign configuration that functions as an enregistered emblem of being an “urban princess.” A growing number of magazines and web forums recycle representations of this register, making such stereotypic indexicals available to a trans-local community of young women, who readily trope upon it through variants of speech and dress, serially formulating forms of positional uniqueness though a proliferation of local variants. Many cases of this kind have been described for other societies in a growing literature. But what kinds of cases are they? Has slang somehow changed when no one was looking? The answer must be a qualified “no.” All the value boundary registers that I have discussed have invariably existed as forms of communication whose indexical values are defined by competing metadiscourses. In the historical literature on “slang,” it is the entrenched perspective of the standard that obscures the existence of metadiscourses through which speakers of a “deviant” object discourse formulate competing indexical values of the registers they use. They have always done so. More recent work simply attends more fully to this fact. Both norm and deviance will always be around, and they will continue to “hang out” together: You can’t have one without the other. And all value boundary registers are transformed—in repertoires, indexical values, and social domains—through the activities of those who orient to them. If something has changed it is our ability to study the implications of this fact for the organization and transformation of society. Once we move beyond a repertoire-centric approach to the thing called “slang,” we find a number of distinct semiotic and metasemiotic processes through which competing valorizations and forms of reanalysis alter relations between modes of discursive practice and hence among those whose practices these are. The set of sociohistorical circumstances and (meta)semiotic processes through which the slang construct once came into felt effulgence and institutional hegemony in standard language communities (whether in Europe or elsewhere) are inextricably indexed by present-day uses of the term slang itself. Since the term is not likely to go away anytime soon, this imbrication is worth attending to by those who purport to study its referent today. Meanwhile as these sociohistorical conditions change, the slang construct becomes less and less useful for understanding those who are linked to it—whether by decrying or defending it, or merely by using some putative sample of it. Once we attend to the (meta)semiotic processes whose variable aggregation appears to yield the slang construct as their visible sum—processes that are ubiquitous in other forms of enregisterment that involve no slang, where other iterations of these processes yield variable aggregations that are recognized as registers of “other” kinds (Agha 2007a)—it becomes possible to analyze the shifting fates and fortunes of value boundary registers of whatever kind we are able ethnographically to observe today, and not just the ones that have hitherto been called “slang” (and hence discussed above), and to do so without being pinioned or fossilized by the standard- and repertoire-centric gaze in whose amber the slang construct was born.

Farmer’s Slang and Its Analogues (1890), but the phrase lacks a clear definition from the very outset. Although minor works on slang and cant are attested from the sixteenth century (such as Thomas Harman’s Caveat of 1567 and John Awedeley’s The Fraternity of Vagabonds of 1575), slang lexicography becomes soundly established as a metadiscursive tradition after the publication of Grose 1785. By the late nineteenth century this tradition begins to acquire encyclopedic dimensions, first with the publication of A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon and Cant by Albert Barrere and Charles Leland, a work in two volumes, and then in Slang and Its Analogues by John S. Farmer and William E Henley (1891–1904), a dictionary in seven volumes, published serially. Once established, the phrase “slang and its analogues” is readily recycled into twentieth-century works by language mavens (works such as Partridge 1933), which also lack criteria (as did Farmer 1890) for establishing the boundaries of the “slang” construct itself. This lack of criteria is clearly described at the outset by Farmer, who coins the phrase (in his preface to volume 1 of Slang and Its Analogues), when he describes the challenges he faced in compiling his data: “The difficulties were manifold and crowded upon one at the very outset. … First and foremost came the question of deciding. … What is Slang? … As a matter of fact, I have not yet discovered, nor have I been able to formulate any definition which covers the whole of the ground to be traversed. As Dr. Murray truly observes, ‘there is absolutely no defining line in any direction: the circle of the English language has a well-defined centre, but no discernible circumference.’ Authorities differ between themselves, and often with themselves when asked to set down in plain scientific terms the marks which distinguish the vagrant words of slang from correct and orthodox English” (Farmer 1890, vi). Lacking a clear definition, Farmer picks “a well-defined centre” instead for staking out his terrain: “Great as was the initial difficulty in regard to a dividing line between the three great divisions of colloquial English—dialectical, technical, and slang—it was clearly and obviously necessary to draw the line somewhere. After careful consideration, I adopted, as a standard between literary and nonliterary English, Annandale’s edition of Ogilvie’s Imperial English Dictionary. With but few exceptions, it will be found that no word is here included which is there set down as forming part of the orthodox inheritance of “the noble English tongue” (Farmer 1890, vii). This choice of adopting Imperial English as a baseline register is simply one example (among countlessly many others in the literature on “slang”) of the ideological framing of slang that I describe in the opening paragraph of this article. 2Contextually inappropriate use is infelicitous not just for positively valorized professional registers such as medical and legal registers of mainstream adult society but also for registers that are negatively valorized by mainstream society, and fluent speakers of these registers are aware of this fact. Examples can be multiplied without limit, but here are a few: In the case of Bahasa Gaul, a slang variety employed by Indonesian youth, the register “is not normally used in face-to-face encounters with adults or older people who are not assumed to share the same youth values or orientation” (Smith-Hefner 2007, 187). In the case of Verlan, a slang register associated with ethnic minorities and the underworld in France, “while youths did want to speak Verlan with friends, they were careful also not to use it in certain ‘public’ settings, and with certain people, to avoid being labeled as racaille” (Doran 2004, 117). In the case of true criminal argots, “most successful pickpockets are careful to avoid argot in their general conversation” (Maurer 1955, 43). In the case of American college slang, students tend to avoid slang in classroom encounters with professors, and avoid it almost completely in intimate conversations with boyfriends or girlfriends, where marking common membership in an age cohort through slang interferes with marking intimacy among persons paired as lovers (Eble 1996, 114–6). 3In some cases, regularities of interactionally projected self-positioning may well be emblematic of membership in specific demographic groups. Such regularities can be described empirically by considering judgments by many individuals (e.g., statistical analyses of questionnaire data, a series of ethnographic interviews), but the unit datum is always an act of metapragmatic evaluation by an individual, and hence an act that achieves a form of self versus other positioning in the course of its own performance. 4The etymology of the word slang is uncertain, but three explanations are widely attested in scholarly and popular accounts. According to one account the noun slang is related to the verb sling, which suggests that what it names is thrown around casually, perhaps recklessly. According to a second account the word is an argotic corruption of French langue, perhaps the kind of corruption we would expect from substandard speakers. A third popular etymology claims a derivation from the phrase “thieves’ language” which somehow got contracted to “[thieve]slang[uage].” All of these may well be folk-etymologies; the last one is transparently so. 5There is an apparent difference between early attested usages of the term slang and early lexicographic glosses of the term. The earliest usage attested in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1756, and is construed by the OED’s editors as an allusion to a town’s local speech, custom and habits, not linked to vagrancy or pilferage. By contrast one of the earliest dictionary glosses is given through the term “cant language” (Grose 1785). Partridge (1933) argues that after 1800 (and possibly 1850) slang was used for all vulgar and low speech except “thieves’ language,” for which flash was then the distinctive term. But lexicographic treatments preserve the association of slang with thieves’ language well into the twentieth century; for example, the American CollegeDictionary (1950), glosses slang as a language “below the standard of cultivated speech … the special vocabulary of thieves, vagabonds, etc.”"
28,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA4 - 2015 - Dualism at Work.txt," This thirteen-year ethnography investigates how two Wall Street banks instantiated dualism in practice and what the evolving consequences were for bankers and the organizations that they joined after their careers at the banks. The banks dualistically split visible controls that targeted the mind, such as autonomy and work-life balance narratives, from unobtrusive controls that targeted the body, bypassed the mind, and intensified the pace of work in ways that bankers experienced as self-chosen. These practices caused evolving forms of dualistic embodiment. During the first four years, bankers identified with their minds and treated their bodies as unproblematic objects. Starting with year 4, body breakdowns occurred; the body imposed itself as an antagonist. Desperate to perform, bankers pushed harder, which caused more severe breakdowns that eventually forced some to treat the body as a knowledgeable subject that can direct action. The bankers implemented the banks’ practices in the organizations they joined subsequently, intending to enhance autonomy, but unintentionally replicating indiscriminate overwork for all participants. As they experienced more severe breakdowns, some bankers followed their bodies’ guidance into new ways of living. Dualism thus followed a dialectic pattern, first intensifying the body repression until breakdowns turned passive bodies into revolutionary forces. Cartesian dualism—the identification of the person with the mind and its separation from the body as the mind’s unproblematic instrument—has been circulating through Western culture. From its early origins, including Descartes (1960) and Kant (1965), who conceptualized the person primarily in terms of cognitive processes, it then circulated into society as “cultural modernism” (Harvey 1989) and inspired the cognitive revolution that refocused psychologists and organizational scholars on the individual mind in the form of cognitive theory. I use the term cognitive theory as an umbrella for approaches that assume an “unabashed commitment to mentalism” (Fiske and Taylor 1991, 14; see also March and Simon 1958; Simon 1976). Cognitive theory is dualistic because it assumes that cognition is the property of individual minds. The body and the social context are conceptually separate and studied only “through [their] residence in the mind of individuals” (Anderson et al. 1997, 11). Scholars have mostly construed cognitive theory as a theoretical framework, as a lens that scholars use to understand the world, and they have evaluated it on logical coherence and accuracy (Wittgenstein 1973; Anderson et al. 1996, 1997). But dualism is also instantiated in the world as a practice. In fact, organizations’ focus on the individual mind has intensified in our knowledge economy. For example, academics teach managers that knowledge work is a disembodied “thinking for a living,” in which “knowledge workers primarily rely on their brains rather than their bodies” (Davenport 2005, 15). Many knowledge-based organizations act as if this dualistic conceptualization were true. They recruit individuals based on intellective qualities and encourage all-encompassing work hours—bankers, lawyers, doctors, and software engineers can work up to 100 hours a week—ignoring the body’s needs and failing to acknowledge its contribution, for example, in the form of health and stamina. Because people thus enact Cartesian dualism, it is important not only to study the theory as a framework about the world and evaluate it on its accuracy. We must also study it empirically, as a thing in the world, and evaluate it on the kind of world that it creates for the persons and organizations who act as if it were true, which is this study’s purpose. Dualism as Generative Theory I build on a set of approaches across disciplines that study scholarly theories as generative, including the history and archeology of science (Kuhn 1970; Foucault 1973, 1979), social constructionism (Gergen 1978), sociology of knowledge (Habermas 1968), critical social theory (Horkheimer 1972), performativity (Callon 1998; MacKenzie et al. 2007), ideational scholarship (Blythe 2002), practice theory (Giddens 1986), and the self-fulfilling prophecy of academic theories (Frank et al. 1993; Ferraro et al. 2005, 2009). Such approaches question the traditional view that theories are merely logical and explanatory systems. Instead, they are “idea technology” (Schwartz 1997): in our expert society, lay persons use academic theories in action and to construct themselves, independently of how accurate the theories are. They thereby enact the world that scholars then “discover.” Scholarly theories thus can be understood as forms of culture that circulate through the world (Urban 2001). Much prior research has focused on the circulation of theories as text, such as categories and narratives. Less is known about their material instantiation in routines, technology, and bodies. Organizations play a critical but so far underexamined role in this social circulation. They structure assumptions about persons and bodies into activities, giving these assumptions a culturally and historically situated expression. Because people are shaped by the activities that they engage in repeatedly and because people often spend a lot of time at work, organizational participants come to embody these assumptions, exhibiting tendencies that support and reproduce the assumptions. Culturally shaped scholars then describe this world and the make-up of its participants as a fact versus as a cultural choice (Dreyfus 1999). Research thus is needed about the socially situated processes that make theories come true and about their effects for participants. Wall Street’s Social Circulation of Dualism I examine Cartesian dualism as it is instantiated in the work practices of Wall Street investment banks. Investment banks are the epitome of the modern knowledge-based organization, which is important to study because it is increasingly prevalent and economically important. They are also an ideal setting for this study because they represent an extreme case of dualism in its valorization of the mind and neglect of the body, as compared to, for example, manual work or athletics, where the body’s contribution is more salient. One novel aspect of modern knowledge work is that while employees in most countries work less when they become wealthier, US knowledge workers work more (Mandel 2005). They work over schedule and on weekends, citing “self-imposed” pressures (Society for Human Resource Management 2009). Paradoxically, it is the most highly educated individuals, including software engineers, consultants, investment bankers, hedge fund managers, and lawyers—with the most attractive employment options—who appear to choose to work up to 120 hours per week (Kunda 1992) and voluntarily make themselves electronically available 24/7 (Mazmanian et al. 2005). These employees work as if the biological needs of the body, such as sleep, did not exist. Modern knowledge work’s extreme body suppression is not sustainable, however. The ideal investment banking candidate has a perfect GPA from an elite school, while also being a leader in extracurricular activities. Yet even these unusually resilient and motivated individuals leave banking after about seven years, partly because they cannot sustain the intense pace of the work, resulting in an average age in investment banking of thirty-five years. Some stay longer, but at a high price to an ailing body, as the following remark demonstrates, in which Robert Rubin, the former Treasury Secretary, recalls his time as a co-senior partner at Goldman Sachs: I was intent on not letting my back pain interfere with … Goldman … , so I did everything I could to keep functioning. For many months, I’d have to lie down at the office on a couch. … I was in the hospital three times … and each time I ran the arbitrage business from my bed. I was on the board of Studebaker-Worthington, and I participated in one meeting lying on the conference table. Once, the CEO of the company … called and asked me to meet him at his office on a Saturday to talk about selling the company. … I couldn’t walk for more than a few yards at the time, or even sit, but I went to [his] office and lay on the window seat … trying not to miss a beat by working from a horizontal position. (Rubin 2003, 88) Exhausted bankers leave Wall Street to assume leadership positions in other organizations, taking their Wall Street socialization with them. Examples include Henry Blodget, Jon Corzine, Michael Lewis, Michael Milken, Hank Paulson, Donald Regan, Robert Rubin, John Thain, and Gary Winnick. Goldman Sachs supplies so many employees to government that it has been nicknamed “Government Sachs.” These dynamics suggest that to understand how dualism is instantiated in modern knowledge work requires studying the longitudinal coevolution of various cultural elements, including narratives, actions, routines, and bodies. Banks and bankers have narratives about what matters to the performance of knowledge work, for example, when they hire prospective candidates based on intellect. These narratives may change over time as bankers’ bodies decline, as illustrated by Rubin above, suggesting that narratives do not exist in a vacuum of pure text. The banks’ practices compel overwork, as evidenced in routine banker burnouts. Even if one chose to ignore the body, defining the person solely in terms of intellectual achievement at some point forces the body itself into awareness, here through breakdowns, in a way that would be hard to conceptualize as text acting on text. To examine dualism as a socially circulating situated practice, I tracked four cohorts of Wall Street bankers for thirteen years. I studied how they engaged in the banks’ activities differently over time, including when they left the banks and took the banks’ practices with them to other organizations. Contributions Prior organizational work has studied the social circulation of theories but construed them in a disembodied way, as text. For example, the institutional literature has examined how categories diffuse across society and influence organizational forms but has lacked empirical work on micro-foundations (cf. Barley and Tolbert 1997; Scott 2008). It has focused mainly on aggregate and "
29,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA5 - 2015 - Message Without Coda.txt," This article investigates the rhetoric of the photographic object in the context of the 3.11 disasters in Japan, where this particular object became essential for both commemorating the loss and communicating to future generations about the danger of a large-scale disaster. Through ethnography of the two different subcultures of photographic laboratory, the article documents various sign processes of the disaster-related photograph and argues that in the context of a sudden disaster, both the duty to remember the past and the hope for alternative trajectories for the future are grounded in the same regimented meaning of a particular object which nonetheless can be used to express different subjectivities. As a free-floating object, the photograph is by its nature antisemiotic in that it resists interpretation unless its visual persuasion is domesticated by “ethnometapragmatics,” that is, the highly coded cultural talk about the sociocultural, political, and historical significance of the image or a set of images. That’s what the world is after all: an endless battle of contrasting memories. —Haruki Murakami (2011, bk. 2) Mad or tame? … Such are the two ways of the Photograph. The choice is mine: to subject its spectacle to the civilized code of perfect illusions, or to confront in it the wakening of intractable reality. —Roland Barthes (1981, 119) As a result of the triple disasters on the March 11, 2011, in Japan (3.11), there has suddenly been a heightened awareness of and the urgent need for remembering the events of the past to prepare for and possibly reduce damage from a future disaster as well as to transmit “the lessons learned” effectively to future generations. However, such a call for preserving the past memory has met with a curious confusion in the everyday usage of the two terms: memory and record. While the terms bear no etymological relationship in English, in Japanese these two terms show an uncanny resemblance in their character compounds: kioku/記憶 ‘memory’ and kiroku/記録 ‘record’. Both words share the same Chinese character ki ‘to inscribe/mark’, while the accompanying character, either oku ‘to recollect’ for memory or roku ‘to record’ for record, makes the semantic distinction between the two. Since the triple disasters, national and popular discourses surrounding preserving ki-(oku/roku) have been pervasive, especially regarding the process of reorganizing disaster-damaged material culture, to the extent that the two terms appear to stand for the same meaning in their usage to indicate anything by which the past event is remembered (omoidasu, literally “pushing out a thought”). Lexicographically, however, each term has a distinct meaning. The authoritative dictionary in Japanese (Koujien) defines “record” (kiroku) as “the act of inscribing a factual text for a later usage,” while “memory” (kioku) is “the act of remembering or the content of remembrance.” The emergent conflation of the two terms is well captured by the March 2012 release of a picture book by 20th Century Archive Sendai, a local nonprofit organization in Sendai, titled 3.11: Record of Memories. Interestingly, the organization’s description of the contents mentions only photographic records being documented in the book but not memories (20th Century Archive Sendai 2012), illustrating that, semantically, the act of remembering and the recording of remembrance are separate experiences. Pragmatically, however, they are two sides of the same coin. 20th Century Archive Sendai’s work is only one of many diverse endeavors that use the same object—the photograph—and its associated techniques and technologies as the conventional instrument for communication and (re)presentation of the past. In this article I discuss two distinct “photograph laboratories” that have emerged after 3.11 in which thousands of photographs are processed and subsequently transformed into memory-record chimeras. In the two subcultures1 within the larger milieu of postdisasters in Japan,2 photographic objects are processed with quite different ethos and pathos. Yet at the same time, they are used equally for achieving the collective goals of commemoration and of communication to future generations about the danger of a large-scale disaster. The first laboratory is a photographic recovery project (PRP) that cleans up tsunami-dampened photographs, organized by a group of mostly short-term volunteers. This group’s ultimate goal is to return the photographs to the original owners, as these objects are believed to be tokens of the owners’ lived memories. The other laboratory is a post hoc digital archive project (DAP), Michinoku Shinrokuden, at Tohoku University’s International Research Institute of Disaster Science (IRIDeS) that aims to archive “all possible memories, records, case histories, [and] knowledge concerning the 2011 Tohoku earthquake” in order to “hand down the disasterography to national and international communities as well as future generations.”3 For them, a collection of digital photographic records regarding 3.11 serves as a mnemonic tool for future remembrances of the past, believed to be a necessary solution for reducing the potential impact of a future disaster. Following Galison’s (1997, 19) critical analysis of the intercalated development of image and logic traditions in the history of physics, I will compare and contrast two traditions of image and logic—mimetic, “homomorphic” representation by iconodules and statistical, “homologous” representation by iconoclasts, respectively—in their pragmatic usage of photographic representations in post-3.11 Japan. This article focuses on the following contention: each subculture equally makes claims about the past disasters, while using the same object in substantiating their distinct claims. Through an ethnographically grounded differentiation of subcultures, I will analyze whether or not these different subcultures come to calibrate a semiotic “trading zone” (Galison 1997, 2010) in achieving the collective goal of (re)presenting the disasters to future generations, while preserving individuals’ particular beliefs and memories of the disaster.4 What distinguishes the two subcultures, notwithstanding each group’s perception of the object, is the modality of object. Whereas the PRP works only with printed photographs whose physicality references the various temporalities of the predisaster time, the DAP mainly deals with digital images taken after the disasters that are, therefore, further distanced from signs of life before the disasters. In other words, different modes of the photographic object, physical or virtual, are asymmetrically mapped onto the referentiality of the photograph. On the one hand, the salvaged photographs used by the PRP volunteers are indexical (contiguous with) and iconic of (resemble) the absent figures and/or the backgrounds framed in the pictures. These photographs primarily stand in place of the absented presence in the recovered photographs since most of the time the people who recover the photographs and the owners of the recovered photographs are mutually anonymous to each other. On the other hand, the DAP’s archived virtual records of the postdisasters are iconic and indexical of the disasters and are thus the type of signs that, one way or another, come to simulate some aspect of disaster in the present and for the future by “making present again that which was previously absent” (Leone and Parmentier 2014, 53; emphasis in original). Those records not only come to be interpreted as resembling something about the aftermath of a disaster but also as indicating the growing reservoir of the collective memory, or terra (in)cognita, of disaster. In the post-3.11 disasters context, those two versions of photographic records are used equally by the two different subcultures as symbolic instruments of “noninterventionalist objectivity” (Daston and Galison 1992, 120; 2007). Therefore, the preexisting convention regarding the photographic object enables both labs to use the photographs to make plausible claims about the past disasters in the present. Given this background, the guiding questions for this article are the following: Through what sign processes are those semiotic tokens of these past disasters interpreted as symbolic, or as conventionally agreed upon alibis, within and across various subcultures? How does a struggle of interpretative habits (Parmentier 1997; Morimoto 2012) both enable and constrain the growth of the very instrument of communication that is believed to preserve the “reality” of the disasters? And finally, what is the rhetoric of the photographic object, if there is any, in the context of disasters, and how can the same object deploy multiple instrumentalities in its usage, while simultaneously “standing in” as and “making present again” the “objective” memory record of the disasters? I address those questions by examining the role of the object (both preexisting and newly constructed photographic images in particular) as an instrument of communication and a sign-vehicle in culture in order to assess the object’s rhetorical effects vis-à-vis a large-scale disaster that is, as Blanchot puts, “an excess of experience, and affirmative though it be, in this excess no experience occurs” (1995, 51; see also Parmentier 2012, 236). Here I am particularly interested in literatures in material semiotics in which the order of objects and the ordering of objects mutually constrain the perspective of the world (e.g., Miller 2002; Edensor 2005; Silverstein 2005; Kockelman 2010; Manning 2012; Nakassis 2012). In addition to such a reciprocal relationship between subject and object in which a cultural process of organizing the order of object masks the ordering of subject, I will discuss how a technologically mediated ethical stance toward the object—the shifting distance between object and subject in relation to each other5—influences the (re)presentation of the disaster—the representing subject—according to different traditions. With the following ethnographic instances that juxtapose two photographic laboratories, I will illustrate how the rhetoric of the disaster-related photographs is located in the conventionalizing alibi of each group’s varying semiotic stance or, as Galison puts it, “a matrix of beliefs” (1987, 277). In the context of a sudden disaster, both the duty to remember the past and the hope for alternative trajectories of the future are grounded in a particular object. The very usage of the photograph in the present further conventionalizes the already agreed upon idea of the object; without such specific usage the photograph is systematically natural and arbitrarily cultural, that is, antisemiotic. Therefore, this article provides an ethnographic case that exemplifies a “circle of semiosis” (Leone and Parmentier 2014) in which the removal of interpretation, that is, the regimented meaning of object, is evidenced in particular usages of the same object that cites the presupposed meaning of the object to validate its usages. In this process the photography is used to (re)present simultaneously as a rhetorical chimera, ki-oku/roku of nature and culture (cf. Batchen 1997). The Signs of Survival One of the earliest tasks of the disaster relief efforts focused on cleaning up material debris unearthed after the tsunami. The amount of waste collected in the three prefectures (Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima) had been estimated in 2011 to be around 24 million tons, about 1.7 times more than the waste produced by the Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in 1995. Much of the waste has since been sent to temporary landfills, where it was then classified into different categories to be processed in different ways.6 In spite of all the machinery used in this effort, there was still a need for human labor. As many volunteers liked to say, “there are things only human hands can do.” Indeed, there were things that machines did not care about, but humans did—photographs, for one. Unlike other objects belonging to the general category of gareki ‘waste’, photographs discovered on the ground were picked up carefully and sent back to the volunteer centers to be processed, as if they somehow had the special capacity to store all the memories of the disasters (fig. 1). A brief history of the photographic image reveals how it can be one of the many potent “signs within society” (Saussure [1915] 1966). Around 1837, upon the development of the prototypic photographic instrument, or the daguerreotype, photographic technology was announced as “not merely an instrument which serves to draw Nature; on the contrary it is a chemical and physical process which gives her [Nature] the power to reproduce herself” (Daguerre [1939] 1980, 13). With the gradual mechanical sophistication of this art of mimesis, a new mutation of the concept of objectivity emerged. The possibility of technology functioning in a neutral, automatic fashion is, according to Daston and Galison (1992, 111), what led to the late nineteenth-century belief that “the photograph does not lie.” By photography’s supposed ability to impartially capture its object or to record the “message without a code,” as Barthes (1977, 17) puts it, photography, a “perfect analogon” (1977, 17; emphasis in original), has become the symbol of human nonintervention par excellence—“mechanical objectivity” (Daston and Galison 1992) so conceived.7 Such a technology of mechanical reproduction emancipated, as Benjamin articulated, “the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual” ([1936] 1968, 224). Photographic technology thereby enabled the magnification of the distance between belief and action by communicating its plausibility, on the one hand, as the unmediated resemblance to an object and, on the other hand, as a narrowly selective transparency (Sontag 1977) where the photograph was imagined to passively capture the object, while filtrating a discriminating interpretation of the mind as a part of objective, natural reality. For its utility as both a naturalizing mechanism and conventionalized instrument of culture, Barthes considers the photograph’s sign process to make “an inert object a language” and to transform “the uncultured of a ‘mechanical’ art into the most social of institutions” (1977, 31). For Barthes, the photographic code signifies a naturalized image of culture. The semioticity of the tsunami-damaged photographs aside, they had to be “re-possessed” in the storage units located just a short distance from the main building of a nonprofit organization in Tōno city, Iwate prefecture. Those photographs came to the temporary PRP lab sometimes from the hands of the volunteers on the ground who happened to discover them among other ruined objects and other times from local survivors who asked volunteers to do something about their presence because, in the honest words of one surviving elderly woman, “those things are very creepy.” Indeed, the misplaced photographs of people were “creepy” because they indicated that the people in the photographs existed before the disasters without further indicating their safety after the disasters. In the postdisasters context, the salvaged photographs had a particular aura of authenticity of the disasters that conveyed both hope but also devastation. The one thing that was tacitly agreed upon by the volunteers was the necessity of cleaning those damaged photographs, which stood as a potent alibi of the devastating natural disaster that ruined many people and things. Such objects, evoking a sense of loss, support Pelling’s pragmatic definition of natural disaster as “shorthand for humanitarian disaster with a natural trigger” (2003, 4). If the volunteers’ effort to clean up the disaster debris provided an on-the-ground perspective (mushinome ‘bug’s-eye view’), the DAP researchers’ effort to put together a collective record of the disasters operated with a view from above (torinome ‘bird’s-eye view’). In a laboratory located on the thirteenth floor of a fourteen-story building, the office windows offer a panoramic view of the coastal side of Sendai City, Miyagi prefecture. Akihiro Shibayama, the director of the participatory 3.11 digital archive projects “Michinoku Shinrokuden,”8 launched by Tohoku University, International Research Institute of Disaster Science, told me that he “could see the devastation after the tsunami from the windows here.” Introducing me to the organization of the lab, he pointed to the other side of the lab: “Those workers are tagging photographs according to what they believe to be the best representative characteristic of each.” Unlike the damaged photographs on the ground, the photographs in the DAP, although they depicted the aftermath of the disasters, had to be “linked” to some aspect of the disasters. Composed of specialists from many different areas—a system engineer, survey researcher, GIS programmer, archivist, and disaster researcher—Michinoku Shinrokuden takes as its mission the project of archiving virtually everything relating to the 3.11 disasters. As one of the projects among the seven subdivisions of IRIDeS, the role of the project is to provide primary resources representative of the disasters for researchers and laypeople alike. Its goal is not only to promote cutting-edge disaster research but also to preserve the memory of the disaster that “shall not be forgotten” in order to prepare for a future disaster. “We need to come up with a mechanism or more properly said a culture,” Shibayama reckoned, “where people kinetically, if not consciously, remember the hows and whats of disaster. You know rajio-taisō [radio calisthenics]? When the music is on, we habitually know what to do without thinking. That’s the kind of habit I want to promote through this disaster archive. We need a disaster tradition.” The tagging workers, who sat furthest removed from the windows in the office, right by the director’s desk, gave tags (taguzuke) rather mechanically to the endless collection of photographs. I peered over the shoulder of one of the taggers at work as he described his internal logic of tagging photographs: “This I would say is damaged building, tsunami, and gareki. That one I would say house, soaked, tree, and car.” To a mere untrained observer like myself, his tagging convention seemed arbitrary. Although some of the photographs portrayed highly devastated scenes from the disasters, the tagging worker did not seem to be disturbed at all by them. He moved from image to image habitually, as if moving his body in time with familiar music. Although at first I did not know the significance of this tagging effort, Shibayama explained to me, “Tagging allows people to search what they want from the vast number of items in the database. Now we have over 300,000 items [as of 2013] in our system, and soon enough we will get even more. We need an ordered way to consistently retrieve the records.” The excess that depleted the human capacity to experience the disasters two years ago (à la Blanchot), now became a question of countering the absence of memory with an effective means of retrieval. In the digital archive lab, the frailty is attributed not only to human cognition but also to the medium of recording. “We should not let go of good images into oblivion, should not let them decay or become damaged,” said Shibayama, adding, “we need to digitalize what we can while we can.” According to Shibayama, the digital is what lives beyond the death of the physical. Ringing true to this characterization, the PRP’s struggle with cleaning tsunami-damaged photographs certainly underlines the frailty of physical photographs. With the ontology of the photographic object with which the PRP coped in mind, I asked Shibayama: if there were no longer an original of the copy, would the copy be the original? Ignoring my question, he replied from the perspective of an earthquake architectural engineer: “Having something is better than nothing. For example, for my profession I cannot trace how an earthquake hits a building if there were no piece of building left.” Our misunderstanding here sheds light on the fact that tracing a past can be differently motivated depending on different subcultures. I further asked about a kind of perception that ascertains resemblance between an original and its copy, despite its spatiotemporal displacement; I assumed, thinking along the lines of the PRP volunteers, that the image in each photograph was perceived to be significant. He, in turn talked about the logic driving the desire to discover contiguity, favoring a more stereotypically scientific vision of a part-to-whole relationship. Despite the difference in our interpretative stances, the actual experience of tagging photographs seems to privilege the image over the logical relationship between the photographs. One of the tagging workers told me about her work: “I like tagging more than other types of work I do such as collecting info [sic] about disasters from websites. Because when I tag, I can exercise my judgment on what each image represents. But sometimes I feel this sense of guilt from looking at those images without having actually seen the sites.” I asked her how people could agree on how to tag each photograph if each worker exercises his or her own judgment. After giving me a puzzled look, she answered: “What you see in each photograph is very clear and intuitive. … You should not make any mistake.” Although her comment suggests that the act of tagging follows the first meaning of tracing, that is, discovering resemblances, what the act of tagging emphasizes more is people’s ethical responsibility toward the past, which is expressed with the negative ethical imperative of “one shall not.” This imperative seems to stand at the intersection between memory (kioku) and record (kiroku) where, in the act of the remembrance of the thing past, a vestigial subjectivity survives beyond the object’s signification itself. Recovering, tagging, and remembering: all are privileged acts engaged in only by the survivors of disaster. At the same time, such acts evoke and further beget some degree of guilt, which at times is expressed as a sense of creepiness, as in the local survivor, or the more conscious feeling of guilt experienced by one of the taggers as she scans through images related to the disasters. It is not a coincidence that many memorials such as the Hiroshima War Memorial and the Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake memorial (to name a few) feature famous signs, plaques presupposing the individual’s moral duty to remember, while explicitly constraining the visitor from forgetting. Whether dealing with physical or digital photographs, someone needs to witness something in these objects while processing them. Ginzburg reiterates Benveniste’s observation that one of the words in Latin for “‘witness’ is superstes—survivor” (2012, 179), and to survive is to stand in the place of something lost. Therefore, the more survivors there are, the more representations of the past may succeed. For both traditions, in the act of working through, the photographic object comes to stand in for the privileged view of the survivors and their ethical duty for remembrance. The question is how this sense of duty is calibrated through the process of “memory work.” Memory Work: Ordering Indexicality “Today is the first day for me to run this session, so please be patient with me.” The supervisor of the PRP lab in Tōno, a woman in her thirties, excused herself, announcing the absence of an expert in the lab that day. Inside the small, dusty storage room, farming tools were placed without much attention to aesthetics and order. There were three large transparent storage containers full of lukewarm water and six chairs; chairs were placed on each side of each container for volunteers to work in pairs. There were at least four rows of laundry ropes stretching from one side of the wall to the other, upon which hung hundreds of plastic clips holding nothing. Only later did I find that the ropes and clips were there for hanging up the cleaned photographs to dry like laundry on a verandah. Six of us, including a supervisor, were there to hang the photographs in a very specific order. “I have done this only twice,” she continued as she wiped some sweat off of her face from the sizzling August heat. Expertise was a rare trait in the room full of transient nonlocal volunteers, and in general this has been one of the difficulties with the postdisaster recovery and reconstruction efforts related to the 2011 disasters. Sociologist Hiroshi Kainuma is one prominent figure whose work sheds light on the predisaster depopulation issues in the Tohoku region. His claim is simple but powerful: the 2011 disasters only exacerbated the preexisting trend of an aging society and depopulation in the peripheral areas in Japan. Although a large-scale disaster physically destroys many structures, it also reveals the stability and rigidity of certain social structures (Kainuma 2011; Morimoto 2012). The relationship to the photograph, the way it is said to come to represent something, is one such manifestation of what Oliver-Smith and Hoffman (2002, 10) call a “deep social grammar.” With as much authority as she could muster, the supervisor described to us that each photograph was preserved digitally first to create the photographs of photographs, before being cleaned, and then numbered in order to track them later. She emphasized, however, the importance of preserving physical photographs, and this digitalization process was, unlike the effort by Michinoku Shinrokuden, just a safety measure: “This is just for the record [kiroku].” According to the supervisor, there were more than 3,000 damaged photographs in the depository as of the day, and our task was to clean as many photographs as we could. Then she put on gloves and grabbed a painting brush to demonstrate how photographs were to be cleaned. “First,” she explained, “you soak the photo in the water, and then slowly brush the dirt off of it. As you can see, the ink from the photo comes off, especially where it is yellow. Please take off as much dirt as you can, but please make sure to save the faces on the photos as much as you can, so that we can hopefully find the owners!”9 As we listened carefully to her instructions, we became nervous: “what if we wash off a face?” one girl asked, timidly. “Well that happens,” said the supervisor, rather apathetic, “but do what you can.” She then assigned a pile of pictures to each pair and two brushes and gloves, telling us, “Start off the memory [kioku] work!” Except for the supervisor, all of us were inexperienced at this task. We introduced ourselves to each other and talked a bit about ourselves. When her turn came, a woman of around sixty spoke, passionately: “I came to Tōno, all the way from Kumamoto [over 900 miles away] to do this! I saw it on TV, you know. I brought a few picture frames with me to frame photos so that I can return them to the owners. They must want these photos back. They are their memories.” Her comment was the signal for all of us to stop procrastinating and get to work. We were all quiet as we began our work, as if consumed by the task itself. The task was very delicate and stressful. Many photographs were badly damaged, and I could see even before working on them that some of them were not recoverable. I intentionally put those more damaged pictures to the side of the pile to avoid working with them, and I saw others doing the same. It was hard, however, to take my eyes away from them; they somehow articulated the impeccable sign of “the anticipated absence” (Parrott 2010, 133) of the owner, and the only way to guess at this riddle of life and death was to reverse the Barthesian paradigm of the subject-object relationship in photography (Barthes 1981, 76) by tracing back “photographic referent” in those objects in front of us. Each photograph must have been taken somewhere for some reason by someone, indexing some distanced time and space as its internal record. Underneath the figure of each photograph lies the context of its (re)production. As nonspecific as this context might be, its alibi of “having been there” is undeniable. The photographic referent, therefore, invites its captives to the “evidential paradigm” (Ginzburg 1979), like a detective who traces back clues or a hunter who deciphers the mute tracks of a prey. Whether or not the detective work or hunt is successful, a story of tracing emerges as the second-order testimony that validates the factuality of a trace in the present (see Ricoeur 2004, 175). “They must want these photos back,” the older woman said with such clear and distinct determination as if she knew, because of the memory work, that the owners had survived. If the dampness of the photographs is indexical of the tsunami, then the cleanness of it is indexical of the effort to undo the disorder created by the former. The volunteers on the ground recorded the dampened photographs as the tokens of their memories of the disasters. In contrast, in the lab in Sendai tagging digital photographs is only the first step of constructing a participatory digital archive. Each photograph needs to be organized with an identity of its own with a description of its contents and the contexts of production. Creating this organizational layer of data is essential for sharing contents across communities, and as an international archiving project, any useful data needs to be organized based on a cross-institutionally agreed upon schema in order to achieve commensurability across different archives. IRIDeS’s Michinoku Shinrokuden is a part of a larger consortium of projects related to the 2011 disasters that includes Hinagiku by the National Diet Library of Japan, the Kahoku Shinpo Disaster Archive, the NHK Great Tohoku Disasters Archive, the 2011 Japan Disaster Archive by Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University, and many others. Ideally, therefore, each item in the Michinoku Shinrokuden should include its own unique call number, the creator’s name, tags, the time and place of recording, geographical coordinate, and so forth, all of which lexical sets are shared among archives. The actual collaborative mechanism is much more technologically complex, and it is beyond the scope of this article. For the purpose of the current discussion, however, it suffices to point out that much of the processing of digital photographs involves inscribing a second-order description of each data point, that is, metadata. Metadata proved to be an annoying issue for Shibayama and others working at the digital archive. “Many news sites have good pictures and articles,” he told me, “but they have no metadata to be able to be incorporated into our archive.” His frustration reveals at least two implications for the process of creating metadata. First, there is a lack of standardization of archiving digital data. This lack of standardization reveals that one of the symbols of globalization—the World Wide Web—is in reality a collection of localized schemata. The conundrum of metadata sheds light on the constraints rather than the openness of web-based information; the searchability of data is only equivalent to the data’s robust metastructural organization. Constructing a user-friendly archive, therefore, is about subtly training the user to accept the structured metadata; any skilled user needs to know the metapragmatics of data, that is, the correct way of using the structured system of data and “trained” way to make judgments about data. However, presumably, most users would type a keyword they think of and get a list of items associated with the specific search term without realizing that those items have been preselected, processed, and categorized in a certain way. The construction of a database is one illustration of how digitalized data are never an aggregation of pure denotative information but rather a set of connoted/mediated information. From this perspective, the often-debated concept of “reconstruction” (fukkō), which may be defined in many different ways by different individuals in Japan, has to be temporarily suspended for the sake of the structural robustness of archive based on “trained judgment” (Daston and Galison 2007). For example, if you search for reconstruction (fukkō) on the Michinoku Shinrokuden archive β1.0, results would only contain archived items from half a year after the disasters, thereby constraining the semantic field of the term to cover activities that began after recovery. However, when the term “recovery” (fukkyu) is put in, results bring up items from the same time period plus items categorized as occurring one month after the disasters or less, indicating that the semantic fields of the two terms (fukkō and fukkyu) are convergent rather than divergent. There are many counterarguments to this kind of semantic convergence, such as the fact that different locations go through recovery processes each at a different pace. Such an argument is testable by further parsing the result of these two searches by observing the differences shown in the spatial information, that is, eliminating the original result by adding a specific time and space to observe which region(s) was faster in recovering and reconstruction. Moreover, different accompanying tags are associated with each of these keywords. In the case of reconstruction, many of the search results are tagged with “people,” whereas for recovery most of the items are tagged with “building.” This association would seem to specify that the term “reconstruction” stands for people instead of things. In order to arrive at such a conclusion, one needs to be equipped with a “disciplinary eye” (Daston and Galison 2007, 48) and an extra motivation to see beyond mere images calibrated according to desired keywords. This schism between the experience of the trained and untrained eye is made possible by the archive’s virtual, linear memory storage. This supra-individual capacity for programmed information retrieval renders the archive’s usage as the method of identifying iconodule and iconoclast that divides up “an epistemic passivity on the part of those who viewed them” (Daston and Galison 2007, 360) and a distanced gaze, that is, a view from above (Haffner 2013). My observation of the process of making such a view from above suggests that the specific rule of categorization is a rather subjective decision, in the guise of an argument for promoting the efficiency of the categorization process. The creators also presuppose what they deem to be the appropriate meanings of such keywords, although at the same time these presupposed meanings get further relayed to the user of the archive. In this sense, the DAP has a tendency to reinforce preexisting knowledge of the disaster instead of suggesting an alternative, more creative understanding of disaster. Second, when attempting to establish an archive, value is placed on the total number of searchable items in the inventory. This is perhaps because of the implicit competition among other existing archives. Although the coexistence of multiple digital archives has been framed as collaboration rather than competition, there is certainly a question as to the need for having more than one archive that performs a somewhat similar operation. Therefore, setting the standard metadata schemata is a political process. The construction of an archive with a consistent set of metadata is a strategy not only for standardizing the particular epistemology of vision but also for governing the order of the mnemonic techniques with which any potential user hopes to retrieve the organized past. As Schnapp points out, the word “archive” has its root in the Greek word “αρχειoυ” or “government”; in its usage, “archive connotes a past that is dead, that has severed its ties with the present, and that has entered the crypt of history only to resurface under controlled conditions” (2008; emphasis in original). An archive, as a stipulating process of vision, reverses the indexical order (i.e., a causal vector; Silverstein 2003a; cf. Inoue 2004) of photographic reference such that it is no longer each individual photograph’s point of reference—for example, a person in the photograph who might still be alive—that constitutes the photograph’s message but rather a hidden algorism that generates a sum of instances that fulfills the message sought. To engage in some “memory work” with the photograph in both subcultures is, therefore, to “indexicalize” it,10 that is, “to change structures, to signify something different from what is shown” (Barthes 1977, 18–19) by inscribing it with a set of constructed codes. It is appropriate, therefore, that the supervisor in Tōno referred to the recovery project as “memory work,” since in the postdisaster context all memories are, though to various degrees, worked according to presupposed beliefs about the meaning of the photographic object. What is at stake, therefore, is a shifting rhetoric of the photograph vis-à-vis its usage by different traditions with different ethical standard toward the past and future. How, then, is the photographic object believed to stand in for and make present again the past in the present, and why? Iconodule and Iconoclasm: The Double Ethos of Shikatanai Take a weathered photo, soak it gently in water, brush off any dirt, and tag it onto the laundry rope. In a small room full of people and objects, the photo recovery volunteers were mechanically reproducing our now-routinized act. The room was enclosed in a bubble of Zen-like contemplation, shutting us off from the ruckus of disaster-relief work outside. This bubble soon fractured when one of the girls emitted with a small, sharp scream: “Sorry, the face is gone!” Quickly approaching her side, the supervisor assured empathically, “No worries; see, there are still other faces. You are doing fine. Even if you wash them off, it is shikatanai [there is no way to do it].”11 This incident disclosed our fallibility and seemed to relax all of us. The magic spell of the word shikatanai restored the secure environment that allowed us to tackle the almost impossible task of saving every face; sometimes we did wash off the faces, but we did it because simply shikatanai. Soon we became more talkative and exchanged our impressions of the photographs, as if the photographs afforded a playground of beautifying imagination of the disaster (Sontag 1965). “What a cute baby girl!” one woman commented, “she is in kindergarten in this picture.” Another followed, “Look she is always with her father. She must be loved.” The third one joined, “Here is another picture with him too. He kind of reminds me of my father.” The fourth girl added, “Oh, look, in this picture she is already in elementary school. Her hair grew, but definitely looks like her mother,” and the supervisor added more, “In mine she looks like she is in college. I wonder if she has a boyfriend.” Being the only male in the room, I shyly said, “Do you think the girl in this other picture is her too? She is wearing a wedding dress.” The older lady quickly jerked her head in my direction and exclaimed: “That’s her. Look at her husband, she found a good-looking one! I want to work on your pile, please! This dress looks like the one I wore for my wedding.” As time went by and many photos of this unknown family were tacked with the clips onto the ropes, we had constructed a full story of the girl through the series of photos: we imagined that she is a married woman of around thirty with two kids. She is a housewife and lives a very happy life with her handsome husband. She looks like her mother and has a younger brother who looks more like her father, who loves her deeply. None of us in the room dared to challenge this fabricated story; the photographs evaded our ability to deny the (absented) presence of this particular person and this particular family. The anonymous girl whose name we had no clue about just hours ago now became alive—it was as if she was a good friend in each of our lives. We did not imagine the story; rather, we thought the story was in the photographs whose recovered images we (faithfully) followed. There was a presupposition that the photographs necessarily reflected the life of the figures in them; only the tsunami interfered with their correct representations. Working with the physical objects to recover what they were turned us into iconodules whose goal was to preserve figures, not the ground. There is something about the concrete object standing, both spatially and temporally, in between the nonvictims and the suspected victims that enables the identification between the two. In retrospect, all we did was to simulate the mysterious and all-powerful sublime nature that had defaced millions of other photographically recorded lives, uncovered on the ground or still missing elsewhere, by first soaking the images of people in water, adding stress to challenge their vitality, and then pulling them out to check their integrity. As the conventional ethos of shikatanai warranted, our power was frail compared to that of Nature. The difference between Nature and us, the volunteers, is that we genuinely hoped for the return of the photographed subjects; we believed that they represented the people in them accurately, and at the same time we selected the objects of “defacement” (Taussig 1999) in a covert attempt to reveal those gradually forgotten, unheard voices of the actual victims of the disasters. In a series of simulacra, the victims nevertheless left impeccable traces of the time and space before the tsunami. The mark of ruin, therefore, served as the undeniable “reality effect” (Barthes [1968] 1986, 139) that bestowed the evidentiality of “the thing has been there” (Barthes 1981, 76; emphasis in original). Such an effect reveals the unsaid “punctum” (57–59) of ruined photographs in the context of postdisaster relief effort. In this particular critical space of hope and devastation for survival, what pulled us toward those ruined photographs was not the question of the ontology of object, or whether it was authentic or mechanically reproduced replica. Rather, it was the persuasive rhetoric of its impeccable here-and-nowness that removed any interpretation to deny this factuality. For the PRP, each photograph conveyed the irreversibility of the past in the present: Shikatanai—there is no way to do it. However, the other subculture did not seem to partake in this idea. Encountering the “unprecedented disasters [mizou no saigai],” the scientific community was reevaluating its efficacy. “There is no way to be able to accurately predict the timing and location of an earthquake,” prominent seismologist Geller warned yet again after the 2011 disasters. In his book published after 3.11, Geller problematized the history of the science of earthquake prediction and its continuous hesitancy to accept the conclusion that there is no way to make such predictions. Geller also discusses the amount of governmental support a scientist gets for related projects, suggesting how the national government is promoting the sophistication of scientific foresights (2011; Geller and Jackson 1997). Initially started as an ambitious and pragmatic long-term project of researching the possibility of earthquake prediction, earthquake prediction science has received expanded federal government funding for completing its mission. Over the course of thirty years, the argument of this possibility turned into a certitude, promising the future success of earthquake prediction, although in reality, many of the researches involved depended on ad hoc searches for signs of earthquakes that could help identify a future one. Although it is certainly the case that seismologists and earthquake engineers alike have not been able to provide accurate predictions and are still trying to prove otherwise (Geller 2011), this is not to say that such an effort has been useless outside the realm of science. According to the most recent prediction, the Nankai Trough triple earthquakes would produce an estimated 320,000 deaths (Yomiuri Shinbun2012). This prediction has been effective (in combination with the horror of 3.11) in raising the awareness of the risk and danger of a future large-scale disaster in Japan, acting as a sort of shock therapy. In the case of 3.11, however, many scientists had predicted a different epicenter. This inaccurate prediction now invites skepticism toward the probability of the originally predicted site to actually be the next one. At the same time, there are voices among the survivors who assert that scientists’ occasional lectures and workshops in coastal areas about the danger of a large-scale earthquake and tsunami helped them to escape immediately. As a part of the scientific effort to counter disaster, Michinoku Shinrokuden has two main goals. One is to collect every possible memory, record, example, and piece of knowledge about the disasters from multiple perspectives in order to facilitate interdisciplinary approaches in understanding the 2011 Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, as well as sharing the gathered knowledge with the public. The second goal is to apply the lessons learned from the 2011 disasters about the nature and scope of an infrequent, large-scale disaster in taking various measures to meet the now-expected Nankai Trough triple earthquakes (Imamura et al. 2012). Although it is not the ambition of the project to predict a future disaster, it wants to make scientifically facilitated efforts to prevent (bousai) and reduce (gensai) the cost of a disaster. Therefore, a large sample size would potentially allow researchers, planners, and risk managers alike to use the archive to simulate many probable situations that could occur in the event of a future disaster. In other words, shikatanai is not an acceptable moral escape for the ethos of science. The duty of science is to find some way to make any improvement. Shibayama himself voiced such sentiments: “I regret gravely, as someone who has been studying about disaster, not to be able to reduce the impact of 3.11.” The DAP presents itself as one way to find a solution for communicating the memory of a disaster to future generations. However, the archive faces a significant problem relating to the rights of publicity or so-called right of likeness (shouzou ken) in Japan. In fact, Shibayama once told me that there are more pictures than the archive can show in public. “There are pictures shared with us by local fire fighters for example, but we do not have permission to go public with them.” I asked in return what the purpose of those nonsharable pictures was, to which he answered: “They are used only by researchers for their research purposes. There are many other pictures of the classified kind. People’s faces are what is not publicly archivable for the moment.” Likeness (or the ability to identify the faces of people captured by the images) has to be removed or obscured from the public gaze. Unlike the photo-cleaning volunteers for whom the preservation of faces was the royal road to the past disaster, for the academic effort to create the record of memories such icons became obstacles. “These are great pictures! I wish we could post them,” Shibayama said to me while running a workshop on the categorization of the photographs. The critical process in archiving the photographs, therefore, is to sort out what can go public and what cannot: whether a photograph shows people’s faces or not. To archive, then, is to downplay the photographic evidentiality of “the thing has been there” by removing faces from the gaze of viewers while maximally preserving the context of images: iconoclasm. Many powerful academic recapitulations of the disaster present no face to be seen,12 while a media archive, in particular, the NHK disaster archive’s web-based testimony documents rather seamlessly show the faces of survivors who agreed, for one reason or another, to be on TV.13 The appearance of faces in archives like the one by NHK indicates society’s interest in seeing how the survivors are doing and what they have to say, while slowly but gradually parting from the images of the past in the tsunami-damaged photographs uncovered on the ground three years ago. Shibayma struggled with this ethical limbo during the above-mentioned workshop: “I think those photographs illustrating fukkō [reconstruction] activities [i.e., local festivals] should have faces. Otherwise, what are we showing?” The difference between an academic project and the national television program’s archive project is the need by the former to ask this very question. Moreover, the DAPs often depend on collecting photographs by asking for contributions from users who did not necessarily acquire any explicit consent from people captured in the photographs. The academic project, supported by various funding agencies, cannot just report what is happening on the ground nor can it simply talk about the past as past or an object as object. It needs to generate a set of interpreted knowledge for a “better” future out of “objects of memory” (omoide no shina; Nakamura 2012) by using the “raw” data, which include faces. Unlike many PRPs, such as the one I participated in as a volunteer, which have a clear goal of returning the objects of memory,14 the DAP aims at sharing the photographs with as many people as possible. In this sense, the DAP’s classificatory process is doubly beneficial to scientists and researchers in that it both protects the right of likeness of ordinary people and provides academia with privileged access to the otherwise protected materials. Such privilege often goes unquestioned by way of the trick of representing the image as logic—that is, as being scientific—which is exactly how postwar Japan sought to prosper by attributing its loss to its inadequacy of scientific knowledge about the atomic bomb (Yuasa 2013). In the historical context of Japan, science came to develop as a particular tradition that strongly bears the alchemic operation of transforming the past into a bright future, like transforming the loss of a war into a potential (technological) victory in the future. The scientific past is a subject of betterment. The bottom line for the academic DAP’s efforts to understand the disasters is the following: whether there is a face or not, the ethos of shikatanai is not an acceptable moral principle for scientists and researchers alike. Geller’s critique regarding the earthquake prediction paradigm is not only a structural issue in the academic sphere but also an ethical constraint of science so conceived. The framing of past instances as lessons to be learned leads to the valorization of a register of likeness to that of contingency by removing the knowledge of the former in palimpsesting it with the latter. Thus, for the archive tradition, a set of photographs needs to be interpreted by experts first in order to talk about the future, because each photograph does talk about some aspect of the past: pars pro toto. Rhetoric of the Photographic Records In the summer of 2012, Japanese artist Saburo Ōta put together an art exhibit in Tamano city, Okayama prefecture. The exhibit, called Driftcards, was a collage of photographs taken in the neighborhood of Tamano port in 2012 (fig. 2). Located over 600 miles away from the city of Sendai, Ōta’s Driftcards seemed to be matter out of place. What makes this set of photographs unique is Ōta’s visualization experiment: the artist manually soaked photographs he took of the port city in muddy water to simulate the impact a tsunami might have on the sights captured in the pictures. He describes his intention with the work accordingly: According to the Tamano City Tsunami and High Water Hazard Map, it is expected that the Uno Ferry Terminal area will be flooded by at least one meter of floodwater; however, this is data from September 2007. My experienced local harbor contacts expect the water to rise at least five meters. In April 2012, I walked along the Tamano port. I photographed the sights of Tamano that I don’t want to lose. These Driftcard works (postcards swallowed by the tsunami) are my assumptions. The photos are ripped or warped in places from being soaked in muddy water [from the site]. Just like the many photographs publicly archived by Michinoku Shinrokuden, there are no faces to be seen in this artwork. Unlike the former, however, all of the portrayed buildings are intact, undamaged though slightly distorted by the water. Through this experiment, Ōta evokes a chronotope of the photographic image in which the object’s citation of the event of distanced time and space creates a “hyperreality” (Baudrillard [1981] 1994) of the city’s damage from the simulated tsunami in the future. Simulation with images therefore is an act of citing both visible past and imagined future in an effort to let the photograph, whose orientation to the past is most visible, present more than it claims. Much like a filmographic representation, photographic simulation takes into account both presuppositions and creations, fiction and nonfiction. Such an act of signifying the photograph reveals the ethical/semiotic stance to the past by exposing the distance between the subject-object relationship: the subject’s relationship to the photographed past is scaled by the former’s act of representing the past. For example, the iconoclastic digital archive produces a possibility for supra-individual simulations of reality that may be outside of one’s actual experience or beyond each photograph. In other words, at the cost of removing the presence of individuality, thus emphasizing the objectivity of each photograph, the digital archive tries to record an omnibus chronotopic memory of collectivity. Paradoxically, then, the goal of a digital archive is the production of yet another iconodule that worships not the idol but the “indexicalized” order of images, that is, the figure of images is reduced to the situation. The digital archive not only washes away hidden beliefs from images but also distances beliefs from actions by favoring post hoc interpretations over the object itself. The effect of digitalization, thus, is to erase the state-of-the-art claim of the photograph—the photographic presence—in order to schematize it. Such archived ideology circumnavigates the preexisting circulatory path of the photograph (see Silverstein 2013) observed by Barthes, whereby people “consume images and no longer, like those of the past, beliefs” (Barthes 1981, 119). This is exactly how the past is dealt with in the present by the iconoclastic DAP tradition. The past is significant so far as it is interpreted as offering lessons for the future to be learned in the present. This is the world where the photographs do not have a message but where each object is the token of a larger message, soaked with hidden subcultural presuppositions. The resulting photographic record foregrounds the epistemology of vision and fixates the eye to the subtly objectified happenstance. There is no longer a thing witnessed in each photograph, but the presupposed objectivity (re)presented by the selectively chosen image of the disaster in question. This is the principal difference between kioku (memory) and kiroku (record) and between the PRP and DAP: differential matrices of the relationship between object, belief, and action, or what I have been calling the semiotic/ethical stance. There is no difference between memory and record as to the ontology of a photograph. Instead, there is a vast distance between the different ethos of action and pathos of belief about the photograph. The confusion between memory and record in the context of the 3.11 disasters in Japan, therefore, suggests the instability of the semiotic ground upon which particular understandings of the presupposed object-subject relationship emerge and compete (Morimoto 2012). Different usages of disaster-related photographs by different subcultures illuminate this point. However, this struggle of interpretations between the two subcultures does not undermine the regimenting metasemiotic function of the object; the photograph is a historically contingent object representing some aspect of the past, and for this very reason the disaster-related photograph, in whatever form, is preserved. Given this essential point, the ethnographic comparison between different interpretative traditions of the photograph suggests two important points. First, the fundamental rhetoric of the photograph is to make its referentiality partially relative, as in Rorschach’s inkblots (see Galison 2008). The Barthesian photographic rhetoric of “the thing has been there” is elaborated by a particular cultural belief about the pathos of the photograph rather than the nature of the photograph itself. This can be illustrated by observing a particular usage of the photograph in relationship to what is actually being claimed through the object itself. The two photographic laboratories in discussion were able to work with different types of photographs as the same object of past memory, while making different claims about their specific interpreted responsibility to the past. The multiplicity of response was possible only insofar as there was the implicit convention that the photographic object stood for some past and that it calls for some action. Ōta’s experimental piece supports this claim, although as a violation of the rule. He used a series of photographs to refer to a kind of future imagined after 3.11 in which a similarly devastating tsunami is prophesied to occur in a different part of the country. However, this rare case of the usage of the photograph interrupts the well-accepted cultural meaning of the photograph as the object of memory by claiming the photograph’s ability to prophesy a future, and therefore the piece did not beget much following action about the object. Ōta’s “inappropriate” usage of the object reflected, on the one hand, the ineffectiveness of his claim due to his violation of the convention and, on the other hand, the openness of the photographic object, which allows various referential potentials in its citation, although they are regimented in their function. The photograph is, underneath its historical, sociocultural, and political motivation, never an evidential claim or an alibi in and of itself but rather a free-floating object that is presented to people who in turn represent it. The photograph, as a presentational vehicle, seems to have a special quality. Munn (1986), following Peirce, calls this special attribute of an object in society a “qualisign,” summarized by Keane as “certain sensuous qualities of objects that have a privileged role within a larger system of value” (2003, 414; cited in Manning 2012, 12). As a hybrid of both an objectified record of a personal history and a new memory evoked in the present by the observer, disaster-related photographs are one example testifying that we not only order a world of objects (record), but also that objects order our world (memory) (Miller 2002). This article adds to this observation by suggesting that the same object with different modalities can be used equally as the legitimate alibi to achieve a collective end by different subcultures, and depending on the semiotic stance of a subculture under analysis, the same object can and does differently order the world and us. This observation leads me to a second point. Because the photograph serves as the site of interpretations for its signification, the more conventionalized the meaning of an object is, the more presupposed its associated action and belief are to a group of people under analysis. For instance, neither of the subcultures ever questioned the photographic technology that produced the photograph itself, nor did they speak their various views toward ways in which each photograph might have been produced. For them, the photograph undoubtedly stood for some aspect of reality regardless of how it was produced. Therefore, in this context, a highly cultural semiotic relationship between subject and object is maximally transparent in that any discourse about it meets with some dull response, if not silence, from the informant. This speaks to Silverstein’s (2001) poignant point that the “limit of awareness” of the “natives” of a culture may present highly coded practice as arbitrary and conventional when, after analysis, it reveals itself to be a confabulated web of sociohistorically ordered indexicalities or a matrix of beliefs and actions. In this sense, much cultural knowledge haps follows the concept of what Galison (2004, 237) calls “anti-epistemology” or “the art of nontransmission,” working to cover and obscure a code of decipherment. In an effort to identify the space between thing-in-itself and objectified thing, Barthes (1981) identified that photography has no futurity in and of itself. This temporal constraint requires people to attribute futurity to the photographic object. The photograph is resurrected in the present when it is recontextualized or “cited” (Nakassis 2012). Equally, the photograph as “a perfect analogon” of the event of photographing necessitates the presupposed order, perspectives, scales, and so on, of things in the world to be shared within a particular tradition. In order for the photograph to have a message in the present, the photographic scene has to be reanimated so as to move beyond its spatial-temporal constraints. The PRP’s narrative reconstruction of the photographed woman via a series of re-collected photographs speaks to this reanimation process. In contrast, the DAP’s ethical obligation to hide faces challenges the archive in representing its implicit categorization of reconstruction as people’s activities. The photographic object in the postdisaster contexts is a powerful communicative tool because, first and foremost, it suggests a possibility of a sharable or tradable (extra)linguistic field of perception that can be interpreted in various manners, on the one hand, and, on the other, the photograph’s prevalent objective claim of the presence of its content in a particular space and time in some past. This leads to my key point: the photograph is by its nature antisemiotic in that it resists interpretation unless its visual persuasion is domesticated by “ethnometapragmatics” (Silverstein 1979, 207), that is, the cultural talk about the sociocultural, political, and historical significance of the image or a set of images. However, the usage of a photograph is always already semiotic because no past can be perfectly reproduced in the present. Both the iconodule and iconoclastic traditions described in the article find this equifinality in their particular ordering of the photographs; the photographs have to be translated into signs. If we take the position that the object itself has a message (Daston 2008), then “the possibility of lying,” according to Eco, “is the proprium of semiosis [sign-process]” (1976, 58). In the coming-into-being of the photographic record, that is, in equating the photographic object as the signs of the past event, lies the Rorschach test of culture. Investigation into the usage of a photograph—the act of (re)citing the past in the present—invites an analysis into an entailment of a cultural apperception of collective experience (Galison 2008). In this selectively visible purview of culture, the disaster-related photograph is the perfect ambiguous sign; the photograph simultaneously stands for memory and record insofar as it evokes people’s duty toward the past and the dead. The photograph is a “possible method to delay the moment [of accepting death]” (Takahashi 2014, 132). Therefore, it can be easy and yet difficult to talk about the photograph (see Maekawa 2008, 107). Within this very objectifiable object people hailing from different traditions have been trying to find traces of the past and clues for the future. Whether such traces and clues are discovered by the principle of resemblance or contiguity, the resulting order of things and people finds its origin anchored in an aggregation of a vanishing object and an emergent subjectivity, a culturally specific semiotic stance that is a trading zone, a zone where any effective representation of an object is made possible. Conclusion Disaster destroys, yet it also unearths a “sign-fication” of material objects, which come to embody a certain matrix of belief and action in their (re)presentation and various semiotic stances in their usage. An anthropology of disaster could trace emerging techniques of the object to retrieve disaster and its anti-epistemological classification process, while carefully demarcating the object from its representation or sign. This article shows the intersection between object and subject in the two subcultures’ tacit tagging of kioku (memory) and kiroku (record) as a part of their usage of disaster-related photographs. The struggle over memories is no longer between various meanings of the object, since no object is ever raw when observed from any scale and perspective. Instead, it is what is beneath the object’s claimed flawless presence—its rhetoric—that clearly and distinctly presents evidence of a codified message that has no coda."

31,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA7 - 2021 - The Language of Suppression.txt," When a society faces a moment of crisis, its language can mirror, expose, and reinforce societal chaos and fault lines. As India came to terms with COVID-19, the coronavirus’ impacts on different populations exposed and widened India's deep social, economic, and religious divides. This article studies the language of India's response to COVID-19 surrounding three major events that occurred in the early months of the pandemic: the janta curfew, the Tablighi Jamaat incident, and the migrant worker crisis. Through an analysis of media reports, speeches made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and representations on social media, we see how forms of linguistic trickery—silence, presuppositions, accommodations, othering, dog whistling, and povertyism—were used to suppress, harm, and marginalize two minority groups: Muslims and migrant workers. This article demonstrates how those in power use language to reflect, shape, and reinforce meaning, social hierarchies, and marginalization in a time of crisis.

32,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/RA8 - 2015 - What Language is Good For.txt," In many bilingual and multilingual communities, certain communicative practices are CODE-SPECIFIC in that they conventionally require, and are constituted in part through, the speaker's use of a particular code. Code-specific communicative practices, in turn, simultaneously constitute and partake of CODE-SPECIFIC GENRES: normative, relatively stable, often metapragmatically salient types of utterance, or modes of discourse, that conventionally call for use of a particular code. This article suggests that the notions of code specificity and code-specific genre can be useful ones for theorizing the relationship between code and communicative practice in bilingual/multilingual settings, particularly those in which language shift and other contact-induced processes of linguistic and cultural change tend to highlight that relationship. This is demonstrated through an examination of how young children in St. Lucia are socialized to “curse” and otherwise assert themselves by means of a creole language that under most circumstances they are discouraged from using.The fieldwork on which this article is based was supported by the Fulbright Program, the National Science Foundation, and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research; immediate post-fieldwork support was provided by the Spencer Foundation.

Five themes characterize the discourses of the first generation of parents who socialized their children to use Spanish, the majority language, as the everyday language of communication: preoccupation with their children’s future, an unfavorable view of indigenous identity, the association of the past with suffering, concern about their children’s proficiency in Spanish, and the inability to force children to learn the indigenous language. These discourses reveal an ideology that views being indigenous as inferior, leading parents to eschew the transmission of their language. "

However, the association between the use of dating apps and sexual abuse remains uninvestigated. The aim of this study was to examine the association between using dating apps and the sexual abuse of males and females. Six hundred sixty-six participants were recruited in four universities in Hong Kong in 2015. Overall, the 1-year prevalence of sexual abuse was 12.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: [9.8, 14.9]) and the lifetime prevalence was 14.2% (95% CI: [11.5, 16.9]). Multiple logistic regressions found that users of dating apps (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.13, p < .05) were more likely to be sexually abused in the past year than non-users. Using dating apps was also a risk factor of lifetime sexual abuse (aOR: 1.83, p < .05). Our findings suggest that app users should deserve more attention in risk assessment, risk stratification, and sexual abuse prevention programs.

Participants completed a survey on whether they had ever experienced such abuse, its nature (contact, noncontact, forced sexual, intercourse), the type of institution (e.g. school, club), and the relationship of perpetrator to victim (peer, caregiver, staff member). Overall, 3.1% of adult respondents (women: 4.8%, men: 0.8%) reported having experienced some type of sexual abuse in institutions. Adult women reported higher rates of all types than did men, with rates of 3.9% versus 0.8% for contact sexual abuse, 1.2% versus 0.3% for noncontact sexual abuse, and 1.7% versus 0.2% for forced sexual intercourse. We conclude that a remarkable proportion of the general population experiences sexual abuse in institutions, underscoring the need for development of protective strategies. Especially, schools seem to represent good starting points for primary prevention strategies.

36,/Users/guomuqi/relavis/Corpora/socialsci/SA-2020-32(6).txt," The current study investigates the modus operandi specificities for the sexual abuse against the elderly. A comparison between sex crimes against adult and elderly victims is conducted following the criminal event approach. The comparison is based on the precrime, crime, and postcrime phases of the modus operandi, operationalized through 53 variables. The sample comes from a French national police database including a total of 1,829 cases�including 130 cases of elderly sexual abuse and 1,699 cases of sexual abuse against victims aged between 18 and 45 years. Bivariate and multivariate analyses are performed to examine the differences in the two groups. Several differences are observed between the two modus operandi. Findings indicate that the precrime phase is the most important to explain these differences, and this phase of the criminal event affects the rest of the decisions taken during the crime and postcrime phases. Specifically, we have highlighted that sexual crimes against the elderly are more violent and occur more often in the victim�s residence. This study suggests that offenders targeting the elderly use specific crime characteristics, and this allows to highlight practical implications in terms of investigation and offender management.
