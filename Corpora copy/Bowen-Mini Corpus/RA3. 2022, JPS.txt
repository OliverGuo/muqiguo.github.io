Burst-transfer boost charger for supercapacitors from subwatt-scale
harvesting sources

ABSTRACT
A burst-transfer controller utilizing a boost converter for efficient charging of supercapacitors under low supplypower conditions (BurstCap) is presented. Efficient operation is achieved through maximum power transfer
point (MPTP)-based burst-transfer control while mitigating leakage of the reservoir supercapacitor by means
of a two-stage supercapacitor topology. Our experimental results show that, within an optimal burst-transfer
window of 50 mV, BurstCap achieves up to 90% charging efficiency while under low supply-power conditions
(short-circuit current of 3 mA and open-circuit voltage of 0.9 V). In addition, we observed a two-fold increase
in charging current compared to conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) charging schemes.
Applying our charging scheme may be beneficial for powering solar or wind-based wireless sensor nodes
in remote environments as well as subwatt-scale power sources such as microbial fuel cells, thermoelectric
generators, and galvanic corrosion sources.

1. Introduction
There has been growing interest to utilize energy harvesting techniques in order to extend the sustainability of remotely deployed
wireless sensing systems. Wireless sensor devices can be powered by
simple batteries, but the use of batteries may also come with economic
and logistical burdens due to the difficulty and expense needed to
replace batteries in remote environments. Thus, energy harvesters have
been utilized to recharge batteries while in the field.
Such a system usually consists of the energy harvesting sources,
energy-harvesting circuitry, energy storage elements (ESE), and a target
load. When operating energy harvesters, researchers typically focus on
maximizing the efficiency of harvesting and energy storage as well
as the driving load. The former is based on the renewable harvesting
sources for charging the ESE, while the latter depends on the ESE for
driving the load.
The energy-harvesting circuitry is a control circuit that plays a
pivotal role in increasing efficiency when charging the energy storage
elements by tracking the maximum power point (MPP) of the energy
harvesting source. In addition, this circuitry controls the efficiency of
driving the target loads from the ESE by duty cycling depending on
the power utility of the loads. In short, efficiency can be balanced
by impedance matching techniques on the energy-storage side or the
driving-load side.
Several maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques have
been proposed to optimize impedance matching on the energy-storage
side such as constant voltage (CV), open voltage (OV), Perturb and
Observe (PO), pilot cell, lookup table, and IV sweeping [1–3]. On
the other hand, the driving efficiency can be the maximized on the
load side by a load matching switch [4,5] or topology-reconfigurable
structure [6]. Another important consideration is the overall lifetime
of the energy harvesting system for sustainable operation. In order
to extend the lifetime, supercapacitors have been receiving growing
attention as an ESE in long-term energy harvesters [6–10].
Supercapacitors operate efficiently when paired with strong harvesting sources, such as solar under high intensity. However, for certain remote environments, where sunlight and wind energy are unavailable or
unpredictable, one may attempt to tap into other subwatt-scale power
sources such as thermoelectric generators (TEGs) [11,12], microbial
fuel cells (MFCs) [13,14], and galvanic corrosion sources (GCSs) [15].
However, charging large supercapacitors from subwatt power
sources is inefficient. Although supercapacitors are an excellent form
of ESE for sustainable operation of harvesters, they have non-ideal
behaviors attributed to the discharge (voltage-vs.-energy) curve and
substantial leakage currents [16,17]. Moreover, their leakage power
grows rapidly with the size (i.e., capacitance) and with the stored
energy [18,19]. It is challenging to efficiently operate harvesters that
charge supercapacitors from subwatt-scale havesting sources, which
may have low ouput-power levels, in addition to combating the leakage
under the low efficiency of the boost converter.
When using subwatt-scale harvesting sources, voltage boosting incurs a non-negligible overhead. During voltage boosting while connected to a supercapacitor, the charging current 𝐼chg may decrease
significantly, depending on the efficiency of the boost converter (𝜂boost)
and the boost-up rate (𝑉boost∕𝑉hvs). The end result can actually be a net
power loss if the supercapacitor leakage exceeds the charging power.
To address this issue, the leakage current can be capped by limiting
the supercapacitor′
s capacitance, voltage, or both. Furthermore, the
voltage of the subwatt-scale harvesting source can drop and stray away
from the MPP due to the low 𝜂boost when the supply power to the boost
converter is low.
It is clear that a supercapacitor charger is needed that is capable of
efficient voltage boosting especially for systems that harvest low power
such as TEGs, MFCs, and GCSs.
1.1. Contributions
In this work, we showcase an efficient energy-harvesting and
supercapacitor-charging technique for use with low-power supply
sources. Our system, henceforth referred to as ‘‘ BurstCap’’ consists of a
maximum power-transfer point (MPTP) based burst-transfer controller
and a two-stage supercapacitor topology. First, we propose a bursttransfer charging scheme to charge the reservoir supercapacitors (of
large capacitance) at the MPTP to maximize 𝑃chg at the system level.
We then design a two-stage supercapacitor topology for efficient charging of the reservoir supercapacitors by offsetting the leakage current
while using a low-power harvesting source.
To achieve a burst-transfer (BT) charging scheme, the chargestrapping supercapacitor (of smaller capacitance) accumulates the energy from the low-power harvesting source, and then rapidly releases
(i.e., burst-transfers) the accumulated energy to the reservoir supercapacitors within the BT window of the MPTP. By this method, the
near-instantaneous release of charging current can overcome the leakage rate of the reservoir supercapacitors. To validate and maximize
of efficiency of BurstCap′
s ability to harvest energy efficiently from
subwatt-scale power sources at the system level, we explore the optimal
BT window size under low supply-power condition of short-circuit
current (𝐼sc) of 3 mA and open-circuit voltage (𝑉oc) of 0.9 V.

2. Background
We identify design parameters that enable BurstCap to efficiently
charge supercapacitors under low-power supply conditions by examining the equivalent circuit model and leakage characteristics of supercapacitors. We then demonstrate how the efficiency of a boost converter
affects the MPP of low-power harvesting sources.
2.1. Model of supercapacitors
Several equivalent-circuit models for supercapacitors have previously been proposed to simulate characteristics of supercapacitors [16,
18,20]. We adopt an R-C equivalent circuit model due to its applicability
for low energy flow and the relatively long timescales of charging and
discharging.
The equivalent circuit model, as shown in Fig. 1, consists of an equivalent series resistor (ESR) 𝑅esr,scap, an equivalent parallel resistor (EPR)
𝑅epr,scap, and a capacitor 𝐶scap. 𝑅esr,scap represents losses in charging or
discharging cycles. 𝑅epr,scap is used to model the leakage current loss
that represents long-term storage characteristics.
When a supercapacitor is charged to 𝑉0 and the terminals of the
supercapacitor are opened, the voltage drop due to 𝑅epr,scap appears as
a decay from the initial voltage 𝑉0
. Thus,


Higher capacitance of a supercapacitor results in higher leakage
current and lower 𝑅epr,scap. For a given supercapacitor, the leakage
current increases with the charged voltage of the supercapacitor as
shown in Fig. 2(a).
𝑅epr,scap can be calculated by fitting the measured leakage currents
over various capacitances using Eq. (3). For example, the 𝑅epr,scap of
25-F and 1-F supercapacitors are 99.2 kΩ and 398.5 kΩ, respectively.

2.2. Maximizing transferred power
The key design consideration for MPP tracking in supercapacitor
chargers is to minimize the power overhead due to MPP tracker itself.
The MPP used by conventional trackers, which typically considers only
the harvested power 𝑃hvs, can be quite different from the MPP at the
harvester system level when taking the efficiency of the boost converter
𝜂boost into account.

The efficiency of the boost converter can be expressed as:

where 𝑃boost is the power dissipated by the converter. If 𝑃boost is
constant, maximizing the extracted harvesting source power 𝑃hvs guarantees maximizing the transferred power 𝑃chg.
However, in practice, the efficiency of a boost converter 𝜂boost is
not constant but ranges from 10% to 80% according to the power
dissipation 𝑃boost. 𝑃boost depends on the input voltage, output voltage,
and output current of the boost converter. Thus, the MPP of the energy
harvesting source shifts based on 𝜂boost.
Fig. 2(b) illustrates this shift of MPP with 𝜂boost, which is plotted by
measuring the output of the boost converter TPS61200 [21] under the
harvesting source condition of 𝑉oc = 0.9 V and 𝐼sc = 3 mA, and with the
output voltage of the converter 𝑉boost = 2.7 V. The 𝜂boost rapidly drops
as the difference between input and output voltage of the converter
increase [22–24].
The MPP of the harvesting source with short-circuit current (𝐼sc) of
3 mA and open-circuit voltage (𝑉oc) of 0.9 V is 0.45 V and is marked
with a square. The conventional MPPT-based supercapacitor charger
for energy harvesting tracks the MPP of the harvesting source to
maximize 𝑃hvs. However, at the system level, the MPP drops down
to 0.677 V, as marked with a circle, due to the varying 𝜂boost. Therefore, the maximum power-transfer point (MPTP) indicated by the circle
should be tracked to maximize the 𝑃chg at the system level. Particularly
under low supply-power conditions, MPTP tracking of supercapacitorbased harvesting systems is an important factor to efficiently charge
reservoir supercapacitors.

3. Design of burst-transfer boost charger for supercapacitor
This section describes the design of BurstCap, which harvests energy
from a low-supply power source, as shown in Table 1, and stores it in
a reservoir supercapacitor via a charge-strapping supercapacitor. We
first explain the principle of operation, followed by the selection of parameters for the charge-strapping supercapacitor and the burst-transfer
window for efficient operation.

3.1. Principle of operation
Fig. 3(a) shows an overview of the BurstCap design. It is composed
of a small charge-strapping supercapacitor (CSS) and a large reservoir
supercapacitor (RS), a boost converter, and a burst-transfer controller
(BTC). The CSS takes the place of the input ceramic capacitor found
in conventional chargers and is of smaller capacitance than that of the
RS.
In terms of equivalent series resistance, a ceramic capacitor would
be more ideal than the CSS. However, it would be challenging to
produce a charging current greater than the leakage current of the
RS. Our proposed burst-transfer charging scheme attempts to address
this challenge, allowing the CSS to overwhelm the leakage rate of the
RS. Moreover, the power dissipated by the boost converter 𝑃boost is
non-negligible. Another advantage of using the CSS structure can be
identified here. Losses due to 𝑃boost can be minimized by depowering
the main circuit of the boost converter during energy accumulation between burst transfers. In contrast, this would be outside the capabilities
of conventional ceramic capacitors.
Typical capacitance values for the CSS and RS are 3.3 F and 25 F, respectively. In effect, the BTC enables (i.e., turns on) the boost converter
within the burst-transfer (BT) window of the MPT point.
As the CSS accumulates harvested energy, its voltage gradually
increases until it reaches the upper bound of the burst-transfer window.
The BTC then enables the boost converter to transfer the stored energy
from the CSS to the RS until the CSS’s voltage drops to the lower
bound of the BT window. Note that this scheme can also be applied
for situations when the harvested power density is high, such as when
harvesting strong sunlight.
In this case, the energy stored in the CSS would be maintained at a
high level, allowing the BTC to continuously enable the boost converter
and charge the RS at the MPTP. Thus, our BTC can be applied efficiently
over a wide range of power-supply conditions.

3.2. Selection of charge-strapping supercapacitor
The capacitance (𝐶CSS) and equivalent series resistor (𝑅esr,CSS) of the
CSS at the first stage are key parameters to control the efficiency of
BurstCap as well as the burst charging time.
The burst charging time is defined as the period to charge the CSS
from the lower bound to the upper bound of the burst-transfer window.
Assuming the current from the harvesting source is relatively constant,
the burst-charging time of the CSS is proportional to 𝐶CSS. The burstcharging time also depends on the loss due to 𝑅esr,CSS, which affects
the charging efficiency of BurstCap as well.
The initial charging time is the time needed to charge the CSS from
0 V to 0.7 V. The initial charging time can be determined by 𝐶CSS and
the supply power from the harvesting sources. Fig. 3(b) delineates the
initial charging time of the CSS when connected to a supply power
of 𝑉hvs = 0.9 V and 𝑅hvs = 300 Ω. The thick gray line indicates the
variation of the 𝑅esr,CSS, which may be manufacturer-dependent. The
typical range of the 𝑅esr,CSS of supercapacitors is less than 1.8 Ω.
To reduce power loss at the first stage, a lower value for 𝑅esr,CSS
is desirable. Considering both the initial charging time and 𝑅esr,CSS, a
suitable capacitance value for the CSS would fall between 2 F and 5 F.
In this work, we utilize a CSS value of 3.3F in BurstCap.
3.3. Adjustable burst-transfer (BT) window
The harvesting energy source is modeled as an independent voltage source 𝑉hvs with an equivalent source resistor 𝑅hvs as shown in
Fig. 3(a). To generate 𝐼sc of 3 mA and 𝑉oc of 0.9 V, we set 𝑉hvs = 0.9 V
and 𝑅hvs = 300 Ω for the low-power harvesting source model. Since the
CSS is initially depleted, we can assume that at time 𝑡 = 0, the initial
voltage of the CSS is 0 V. For 𝑡 > 0, the CSS will begin charging, and
the voltage across the supercapacitor (𝑉CSS) can be expressed as:

Note that in this expression, 𝑅esr,CSS is not considered, as it is negligible
compared to 𝑅hvs of the source resistor.
A BTC has been implemented with the circuit as shown in Fig. 3(c).
𝑉OL and 𝑉OH respectively denote the low- and high-state saturation
voltages. 𝑉TH− and 𝑉TH+ are the low- and high-threshold voltages,
namely the lower and upper bounds of the BT window, respectively.
They can be expressed as

Hence, the size of the BT window can be expressed as

4. Modeling of BurstCap charger
We analyze the performance of BurstCap in terms of the system
efficiency and the BT-cycle leakage of supercapacitors. We also describe
our maximum power transfer point tracker for BurstCap.

The efficiency of the proposed burst-transfer charging system
𝜂burst,trf is the ratio of the total input energy to the BurstCap charger
(𝐸in,tot) to the increase in the RS’s energy level from the start time
(𝑡
start) to the end time (𝑡end) of the charging phase.
By excluding 𝐸leak,RS, which is the leakage energy of the RS, the
efficiency of the BurstCap system itself 𝜂burst,trf can be formulated as

where 𝐸RS(𝑡
start), 𝐸RS(𝑡end) can be obtained by measuring the initial
voltage of the RS at 𝑡
start and the charged voltage of the RS at 𝑡end.
However, the total input energy to the BurstCap charger 𝐸in,tot can be
obtained by calculating the total output energy from the CSS during the
multiple BT cycles.
Fig. 4 illustrates the single BT cycle. During a BT cycle (𝑇bc), the
boost converter of the BurstCap is enabled only for a time duration of
𝑇en and is otherwise disabled for a time duration of 𝑇dis. Therefore,
the input energy of the BurstCap charger during a BT cycle (𝐸in,bc)
is the same as the energy output by the CSS during the enable time
(𝐸en). Similarly, the amount of energy output from the CSS during 𝑇en

is ideally identical to that of the charging energy of the CSS during the
disabled period (𝐸dis). That is,

Due to the near instantaneous period of 𝑇en as well as a relatively small
voltage drop during 𝑇en, below the decimal point of mV, it may be
difficult to detect 𝐸en by practical methods. Instead, by measuring the
voltage of CSS during the time of 𝑇dis, we can calculate 𝐸dis, which
should be equivalent to 𝐸en. Therefore, from Fig. 4, the input energy
of the charger during a BT cycle can be written as

4.2. The BT-cycle leakage of supercapacitors
The proposed burst-transfer charging scheme is productive only if
it can be charged during 𝑇en in excess of the leakage energy from RS
during 𝑇dis. Therefore, the leakage energy, the BT-cycle leakage, is a
crucial factor to determine the potential charging ability of BurstCap.
Based on Fig. 4 and Eq. (1), assuming that the initial voltage 𝑉0 =
𝑉RS(𝑡1
), we can obtain the one BT-cycle leakage of the RS:

4.3. Maximum power transfer point tracker for BurstCap
MPP tracking techniques proposed to date include hill-climbing,
constant voltage (CV), Perturb and Observe (P&O), pilot cell, lookup
table, and I–V sweeping [1,3]. However, as discussed in Section 2.2,
conventional MPP tracking methods target the maximum 𝑃hvs regardless of 𝜂boost. This section describes our MPTP tracker, which tracks 𝑃chg
to maximize transferred power to the RS rather than maximizing power
extracted from the harvesting source 𝑃hvs.

Fig. 5 shows the circuit diagram of our MPTP tracker, which corresponds to the gray box in Fig. 3(a) for our BurstCap system. It utilizes a
lookup table (LUT) for MPTP tracking, which consists of pre-measured
𝑉OC of the low-power harvesting sources and calculated value of 𝑉 𝑅1
for MPTP.
In more detail, the switch S1 is for the power path control between
the low-power harvesting source and the CSS, while the switch S2 is for
the 𝑉BV and 𝑉ref for the external interrupt (Ext. INT). While alternating
between S1 and S2 based on the Timer, if 𝑉ref is out of bound [𝑉UB, 𝑉LB],
then an interrupt is triggered, at which time the microcontroller unit
(MCU) starts to track the MPTP based on the Algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode for the MCU to perform MPTP
tracking. The MCU sets up the timer to perturb the power path by
alternating control of S1 and S2, and then the comparators of the MPTP
Tracker monitor the variance of 𝑉ref. If the voltage of the harvesting
source changes over time, the MCU can be called by an interrupt to
measure 𝑉OC and adjust digital potentiometers 𝑉 𝑅1 according to the
LUT for MPTP operation. The MCU can then turn off switch S3 and
enter sleep mode.

5. Experimental results
We implemented the BurstCap on a printed circuit board (PCB) with
a 3.3-F CSS and a 25-F RS, as shown in Fig. 6. We tested it under the
low supply-power condition of the photomicrobial solar cell in [25,26],
where 𝐼sc = 3 mA and 𝑉oc = 0.9 V.
To validate the BurstCap design as a supercapacitor charger, we
first confirm that the BTC operates as intended. Secondly, we explore

several BT window sizes to select for maximum efficiency under low
supply-power conditions. Finally, we elaborate on the boundary of
leakage-offset current of supercapacitors to show that our proposed
burst-transfer charging scheme is more efficient than the conventional
MPPT-based supercapacitor chargers.

5.1. Operation of BTC
Figs. 7(a), (b) shows the probing results during burst-charging
phase at 𝑉MPTP = 0.677 V with the BT window of 50 mV. The BTC turns
on the boost converter and delivers the stored energy from the 3.3-F
CSS to the 25-F RS for the very short duration of 500 μs compared to
the BT cycle of 700 ms. As soon as the 3.3-F CSS’s voltage (blue solid
line) reaches the lower bound of the BT window (i.e., 𝑉TH−= 660 mV),
the BTC turns off the boost converter, and the harvesting source starts
to charge the 3.3-F CSS again up to the upper bound of the BT window
(i.e., 𝑉TH+ = 710 mV).
The BTC can eventually charge the 25-F RS while alternating between a higher charging rate and a lower leakage rate. As the voltage
of the supercapacitor approaches the rated voltage, the leakage current
increases rapidly, resulting in a decreased charging rate.
5.2. Optimal burst-transfer window size
To identify the optimal BT window size during the low supplypower condition, we explored BT window sizes ranging from 10 mV
to 70 mV, in 20 mV steps. Fig. 7(c) shows the measured voltage of
the 25-F RS during charging phase. We observe that our MPTP-based
burst-transfer charging scheme can charge the 25-F RS significantly
faster than the conventional MPPT charging scheme at the low powersupply condition of 𝐼sc = 3 mA and 𝑉oc = 0.9 V. Reasons for the lower
efficiency of the conventional MPPT-based supercapacitor are twofold:
(1) the MPP shift is not considered, and (2) the boost converter isenabled continuously even when the supply power is low, resulting in
unnecessary power overhead.
Fig. 7(d) shows a zoomed-in view for the 25-F RS. For our given
test conditions, BurstCap achieves the fastest charging rate at 𝑉MPTP =
0.677 V with a BT window size of 50 mV.
Fig. 8(a) indicates that the charging efficiency 𝜂burst,trf depends
on the several sizes of the BT window. 𝜂burst,trf is maximized when
BurstCap is operating at 𝑉MPTP = 0.677 V with the BT window of 50 mV.
That is, when the range of the BT window is preset from 660 mV to
710 mV of the 3.3-F CSS, the efficiency of the charger is increased, up
to 90%. Therefore, using the subwatt-scale harvesting source, we have
shown optimal BurstCap charging parameters on the 25-F RS.

5.3. Boundary between charging current and leakage current
The primary disadvantage of supercapacitors is the high leakage
current, which must be addressed in order to successfully charge the RS
under low supply-power conditions. To overcome the leakage of the RS,
the charging current has to offset the leakage current of the RS. When
the charging current is equal to the leakage current, the RS receives no
net charge. We define this condition as the boundary of leakage-offset
current 𝐼lo. In this sense, the 𝐼lo can be obtained at the moment when
the leakage energy becomes equal to the charging energy of the RS.
The leakage-offset current is
The boundary of 𝐼lo can be an important parameter to evaluate
the charging performance of the supercapacitor charger. If the leakage current 𝐼leak,RS of the RS is lower than the boundary of 𝐼lo, the
supercapacitor charger can fully charge the RS by offsetting 𝐼leak,RS.
Using Eq. (18), Fig. 8(b) plots the boundary between the charging
current and leakage current. The boundary of our proposed BT charging
scheme is indicated by the black solid line, while the conventional
MPPT-based charging scheme is marked by a black dotted line. In
addition, the blue dotted line indicates the leakage current of the 25-F
RS, and the blue dotted-dashed line shows the leakage current of the
50-F RS.
These results show that conventional MPPT-based supercapacitor
chargers can charge the 25F-supercapacitor up to 2.5 V, while they
can charge the 50F-supercapacitor up to only 2.01 V. In contrast, the
proposed burst-transfer charging scheme can charge both the 25 F and
50 F supercapacitors up to 2.5 V.
In effect, our proposed BT charging scheme can charge twice as fast
as the conventional MPPT charging scheme, with Table 2 summarizing
the comparison results.

6. Conclusions and future work
Our work focused on developing an MPTP-based burst-transfer
boost supercapacitor charging system, named BurstCap, for efficient
charging of supercapacitors from subwatt-scale harvesting sources such
as MFCs, TEGs, and GCSs. Our BurstCap achieves the highest charging
efficiency 𝜂burst,trf by finding the optimal BT window at the 𝑉MPTP, as
confirmed by our experimental results on a prototype implementation.
When charging from a low-power source with 𝐼sc = 3 mA and 𝑉oc =
0.9 V, the proposed BT charging method can charge a 25-F RS from 0 V
to 2.5 V within 112 h, which was approximately twice as fast compared
to the conventional MPPT scheme. This is due to several reasons: (1)
the conventional MPPT scheme has lower leakage-offset current due to
the continuous power consumption of the boost converter, (2) overhead
of the MPPT tracker, and (3) inaccurate MPP tracking due to varying
efficiency of the boost converter. Our BurstCap charger has significantly
higher charging current compared to the conventional MPPT charging
scheme. We also show a maximum charging efficiency up to 90%
while under a low supply-power conditions, which represents a notable
improvement over the conventional method.
Future work includes an optimization that allows for greater dynamic range of the system. In our study, we evaluated the performance
of our BurstCap at short-circuit current of 3 mA and open-circuit
voltage of 0.9 V, which are classified as low supply-power conditions.
However, these parameters may not apply in all cases. For example, the
output of a harvesting source can vary depending on the environment
(e.g., temperature, light intensity). We plan to build microbial fuel cells
(MFCs) as the subwatt-scale power source with varying conditions for
BurstCap to harvest from. Finally, we plan to deploy more BurstCap
units in real-world settings to validate its performance over longer
timespans. BurstCap can serve as the basis for efficient charging of
supercapacitors for subwatt-scale harvesting sources.
