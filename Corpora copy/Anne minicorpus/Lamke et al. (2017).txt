Epigenetic and chromatin-based
mechanisms in environmental stress
adaptation and stress memory in plants
Jörn Lämke and Isabel Bäurle*

Abstract
Plants frequently have to weather both biotic and
abiotic stressors, and have evolved sophisticated
adaptation and defense mechanisms. In recent years,
chromatin modifications, nucleosome positioning, and
DNA methylation have been recognized as important
components in these adaptations. Given their potential
epigenetic nature, such modifications may provide a
mechanistic basis for a stress memory, enabling plants
to respond more efficiently to recurring stress or even
to prepare their offspring for potential future assaults.
In this review, we discuss both the involvement of
chromatin in stress responses and the current evidence
on somatic, intergenerational, and transgenerational
stress memory.

Introduction
Climate change is expected to increase the prevalence of
extreme environmental conditions, including extreme
weather events and increased average temperatures.
Crop yield losses that are connected to these changes
are inevitable [1, 2]. Thus, improved stress tolerance is a
major breeding target. The acute responses to different
stresses are relatively well studied, but in nature stress is
often chronic or recurring and responses to this type of
stress are much less understood. Recent studies suggest
that plants have a stress memory that supports adaptation to recurring stress [3–7]. One possible, but largely
unexplored, way to improve stress tolerance in crops
may thus be to enhance the stress memory through the
activation of priming responses or the targeted modification of the epigenome.

The structure of chromatin regulates the accessibility
of genes for the transcriptional machinery, and is thus
an integral part of regulated gene expression in stress
responses and development [8, 9]. In essence, the positioning and spacing of nucleosomes as well as their posttranslational modification, together with methylation of
the DNA, affect both the overall packaging and the accessibility of individual regulatory elements. The basic
units of chromatin are the nucleosomes, consisting of
histone octamers of two molecules each of histone H2A,
H2B, H3, and H4, around which 147 bp of DNA are
wrapped in almost two turns. The length of thee unpackaged linker-DNA sections between two nucleosomes varies, and this—together with binding of the
linker histone H1—contributes to overall packaging.
Chromatin structure is further altered by the posttranslational modification of histone tails (e.g., acetylation,
methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination), the
occupancy and precise positioning of nucleosomes, and
the incorporation of histone variants that replace the canonical histones. In addition, the DNA can be modified
by cytosine methylation that affects the accessibility of
the underlying DNA sequence but does not change the
genetic code or base pairing. In plants, cytosines may be
methylated in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG, or
CHH) and, depending on the context, symmetrical and
asymmetrical DNA methylation is distinguished [10, 11].
Symmetrical (CG) DNA methylation has a straightforward
mechanism of inheritance through DNA replication; replication results in two hemi-methylated daughter strands
and a DNA methyltransferase can be recruited to these
sites to fill in the missing methylation mark on the newly
replicated daughter strand. Owing to this faithful mode of
mitotic inheritance, symmetrical DNA methylation is
often referred to as an epigenetic mark (Box 1).
Here, we review the current knowledge on chromatinbased stress memory in the model plant species Arabidopsis

Box 1. Definition of specific terms used in this review
Epigenetic phenomenon—A stable and heritable (through cell
divisions) change in gene expression that is independent of
DNA sequence changes and is, in principle, reversible.
Epigenetic modification—A term commonly used to describe
a change in nucleosome structure caused by histone
modifications, histone variants, or modification (methylation) of
the DNA. These changes are not necessarily epigenetic (see
‘epigenetic phenomenon’) in the sense that they are stable
through cell divisions, but (such as symmetrical DNA
methylation) some might be.
Priming—Phenomenon through which a transient biotic or
abiotic stress cue leads to modified (typically faster or stronger)
defense responses upon exposure to a recurring stress (cf.
Fig. 1). Described for immunity and for responses to various
abiotic stresses.
Stress memory—Describes the phenomenon through which
information on a past stress cue is retained and results in a
modified response upon a recurring stress or a sustained
response after the priming stress cue (see ‘priming’).
Transcriptional memory—Sustained differential response in
gene expression after an exogenous cue. Transcriptional
memory can be evident from either sustained changes in
expression (activation or repression) or from a modified

crop plants [3–7, 12, 13], we focus on cases in which some
insight on the molecular mechanism is available. We also
discuss emerging general principles. Finally, we consider future directions for research in studying the epigenetics of
stress response and their application for crop improvement.

Priming and stress memory
Stress in plants is caused by extreme growth conditions
that inhibit normal growth and development and which
may be lethal in extreme cases. Such conditions may be
caused, for example, by extreme temperatures, too little
or too much water (drought or flooding, respectively), or
pathogen and herbivore attack. Priming of organismal
responses to stress describes the phenomenon by which
a temporally limited environmental stimulus (a ‘priming
stress cue’) modifies a plant for future stress exposure
(a ‘triggering stress cue’) [5, 6]. The term priming was
originally coined in the context of immunity against
pathogens (biotic stress), but was later also applied to
responses to abiotic environmental conditions. While
in the primed state, the plant responds to the triggering
stress cue with a response that is modified when compared to that of a plant in the naïve (unprimed) state
(Fig. 1). Priming acts at the phenotypic level and does
not introduce changes in DNA sequence and is thus reversible eventually [5, 6]. Generally, such priming is evidenced by a stronger or faster response pattern, as can

inherited stress memory. Given the many reviews on priming and stress memory published in the past decade that

Naïve

plant may be primed by exposure either to stress or to other priming
cues such as volatiles. Upon exposure to a triggering stress cue, the
response pattern differs markedly in primed and naïve plants. The
primed plant may respond to the triggering stress cue faster/earlier or
more strongly than a naïve plant. It may also respond in a sensitized
fashion so that the response is triggered at a lower threshold. The
primed plant may further change its response pattern to regulate a
network of genes that differs from that involved in a naïve plant.
None of these responses are exclusive and combinations thereof

be exemplified by the modified activation kinetics of
defense gene expression.
The priming event is directly followed by a period of
stress memory [14]. This involves the storage of information on the priming stress cue after the cessation of
the stress, and can be detected as a modified response to
the triggering stress cue when compared to that of a
naïve plant. The duration of this memory may often be
in the range of days to weeks for somatic stress memory,
but in some cases may extend to the offspring (inter- or
transgenerational stress memory). Similarly, a memory of
an exogenous cue may also occur in stress-independent
contexts (for example, during vernalization; see below).
One possible manifestation of the memory is a modified
transcriptional response (transcriptional memory) [15, 16],
during which the priming stimulus induces either
sustained changes in gene expression (activation or repression) or a modified transcriptional response (such
as hyperinduction) upon a secondary stimulus. Other
mechanisms also exist and may involve transcriptional
feedback loops (such as autoactivation of a transcription factor) or posttranslational mechanisms (influencing protein stability or protein modifications) [17].
Another form of a self-perpetuating memory that is independent of transcription is the transmission of
prions or prion-like proteins, whose mutant conformation induces the conversion of wild-type proteins into
the prion state [18–20]. Notably, prion switching in response to environmental stress has been described in
yeast [21]. Also in yeast, transcriptional memory of
galactose-induced transcription is transmitted cytoplasmically and depends on the galactokinase Gal1 [22–24].
Chromatin-based processes in the nucleus—such as SWI/
SNF-dependent chromatin-remodeling, the inclusion of
histone modifications and variants, and subnuclear localization—are also involved in this and other examples of
transcriptional memory in yeast [23–25].
For every case of stress memory, the possibility of an
epigenetic basis must be confirmed. By definition, this
requires that the phenomenon is both stable and heritable (through cell divisions), yet independent of DNA
sequence change and thus at least in principle reversible.
A truly transgenerational stress memory is very likely to
be epigenetic, but this may not hold for somatic stress
memory because of the shorter duration. It is not yet
clear whether many of the observations that we review
here can indeed be labeled ‘epigenetic’ in the strict sense
of the definition (Box 1). In addition, the term ‘epigenetic
mechanisms’ has been adopted by the scientific literature
to encompass all of the parameters that impact on the
structure of chromatin, including DNA methylation,
whether or not they are stably inheritable. This term
provides a convenient label for chromatin modifications
(both on histones and DNA) and thus is hard to

eradicate, but this wide definition has caused considerable confusion. Consequently, in the scientific field, the
view has gained acceptance that the term ‘epigenetic
mechanisms’ should only be used when referring to
truly epigenetic phenomena.

The role of chromatin in acute stress responses
Chromatin has long been viewed as the interface between
the environment and the genome. The flexibility and dynamics of chromatin influence the accessibility of gene
loci to the transcription machinery and hence modulate
the interpretation of the information encoded in the DNA
sequence (reviewed in [26–28]). To illustrate the intricate
connection between stress responses and chromatin regulation, we highlight a few recent examples here. Many
more studies have reported a link between chromatinbased mechanisms and stress-responsive gene expression,
and we refer to several recent reviews that cover different
aspects of the subject [7, 12, 29, 30].
Stress-induced transcription factors may directly recruit histone-modifying complexes. A pertinent example
of this is the specific recruitment of the COMPASS
H3K4 methyltransferase complex by stress-activated
bZIP transcription factors [31]. The histone lysine methyltransferases SDG8 and SDG25 have been shown to
regulate plant immunity through H3K4 and H3K36
methylation of defense-related target genes [32]; how
they are targeted to specific loci, however, remains unclear. The remodeling of nucleosomes is another stressrelated chromatin modification that plays an important
role in abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated stress responses.
There is now convincing evidence that the SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling protein BRAHMA (BRM) represses ABA target genes in the absence of stress. BRM
has emerged as a direct target of the ABA signaling cascade and its activity is regulated by ABA-dependent
phosphorylation [33, 34]. Other chromatin remodelers
of the same class have been implicated in defense responses and growth arrest in response to environmental
perturbations [35–37]. Furthermore, DNA methylation
and demethylation pathways play a role in the adaptation to non-viral pathogens [30], although the exact
mechanisms involved in these defense responses remain
elusive.
At the experimental level, it is often challenging to distinguish correlation and causality. Moreover, the fact
that a chromatin regulator is required for a certain stress
response does not necessarily mean that it actively controls that stress response [12]. It may simply be involved
in bringing about changes in gene expression that come
with this response rather than a participant in the endogenous regulation of the process. Moreover, the
knockout of a chromatin regulator may produce altered
stress responses not because of direct or specific

regulation of stress responsive genes, but rather as an indirect consequence of developmental, morphological, or
metabolic alterations.

RNAs. Although cold temperature is the trigger of this
epigenetic switch, it is considered to be a developmental
signal.

Somatic stress memory
Most responses to abiotic stress exposure or pathogen
attack that involve chromatin features are transient and
return quickly to baseline levels after normal conditions
have been restored. In some cases, however, a more sustained response and evidence of a somatic stress memory have been observed (Box 1 and Table 1) [3, 5, 6, 38].
Vernalization provides a classic example of environmentally mediated epigenetic gene silencing. Vernalization is
the acceleration of the transition to flowering by a prolonged period of cold temperatures (usually winter). The
vernalization memory is stored for weeks to months
after the cold has subsided [39]. In Arabidopsis thaliana,
this involves epigenetic silencing of the FLOWERING
LOCUS C (FLC) gene through H3K27 trimethylation
[40–42]. This histone modification is deposited at the
FLC locus by a cold-activated polycomb group complex
that is targeted through cis elements and non-coding

Role of histone methylation

The involvement of chromatin modifications in stress
priming was first reported in systemic acquired resistance (SAR) after changes were observed after treatment
with bacterial pathogens or with the salicylic acid (SA)analogon acibenzolar S-methyl, a benzothiadiazole (BTH)
[43]. This priming was associated with sustained changes
in histone modifications at several loci that showed
priming-dependent transcriptional memory after a lag
phase of several days. In particular, histone H3K4me2 and
H3K4me3 were enriched in primed leaves. In line with
the systemic nature of SAR, the changes in histone modifications were also found in leaves that were not treated
with the priming stress cue. Throughout the genome,
H3K4me3 correlates well with gene expression, but the
association of H3K4me2 with active transcription is less
pronounced [44]. Both modifications have also been implicated in other stress memory phenomena and they

may mark chromatin that is poised for transcription more
generally [45]. Priming of defense-related genes is lost in
mutants in which the transcriptional regulator HEAT
SHOCK FACTOR B1 (HSFB1) is lost [46].
Heat stress is highly fluctuating in nature. Sublethal
heat stress primes a plant to withstand subsequent high
temperatures that are lethal to an unadapted individual.
The acute responses to heat are generally referred to as
heat shock response and the core mechanism is highly
conserved across all eukaryotes [47–50]. Recently, it has
been realized that plants also have a heat stress memory,
during which acquired thermotolerance is actively maintained and which was described first at the physiological
level [51–53]. This heat stress memory involves both
types of transcriptional memory, sustained induction
and enhanced re-induction [53, 54]. A subclass of heatinducible genes show sustained activation after a priming heat stress and/or enhanced induction upon recurring heat stress. These genes are referred to as memory
genes. The transcriptional memory was associated with
hypermethylation of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 that was
maintained for at least 2 days after the end of a heat
stress [54]. Because not all heat-inducible genes are
memory genes, it was possible to show that the observed
H3K4 hypermethylation is not a direct consequence of
heat-induced transcription, as the heat-inducible HSP70
gene did not accumulate H3K4 hypermethylation [54].
Similarly, genetic analysis revealed that the activation of
memory genes itself did not induce H3K4 hypermethylation; in a mutant in which the transcription factor
HSFA2 is defective, memory genes were initially activated but then quickly switched off and H3K4 hypermethylation was reduced. Interestingly, HSFA2 seems to act
in a hit-and-run mode, with a peak binding to target
genes early after heat shock and a steep decline within a
few hours [54–56]. HSFA2 is required, however, for sustained accumulation of H3K4me2/3, which is maintained at high levels for several days [54]. How HSFA2
mediates this sustained chromatin modification remains
to be investigated.
To identify chromatin changes after salt priming
globally, Sani et al. [57] performed genome-wide profiling of H3K27me3 after a triggering salt treatment on
the roots of plants that had been primed with a mild salt
treatment 10 days earlier. The dose of the priming salt
treatment did not affect morphology, but at the physiological level, it resulted in reduced salt uptake and enhanced drought tolerance upon a triggering stress cue
administered after a memory phase of 10 days. The most
striking changes at the chromatin level were a decrease in
H3K27me3 at the edges of H3K27me3-enriched islands in
the genome, resulting in a shortening and fractionation of
these islands [57]. In addition, some genes showed a
modified upregulation upon a second salt treatment, but

no direct correlation with altered histone modifications in
these genes could be found.
Nucleosome occupancy and transcriptional memory

Besides H3K4 hypermethylation, nucleosome remodeling
has very recently been implicated in heat stress memory
[58]. The FORGETTER1 (FGT1) gene was identified from
a forward mutagenesis screen for factors required for the
sustained induction of a heat stress memory gene. FGT1
encodes a putative helicase and interacts with chromatin
remodeling complexes including the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeler BRM. Like FGT1, BRM is specifically required
for heat stress memory but not for the immediate heat
shock response [58]. The sustained induction of memory
genes was associated with a sustained decrease in nucleosome occupancy that required the heat-responsive binding
of FGT1 to the transcriptional start site of the memory
locus. FGT1 is a highly conserved protein that is also
present in metazoans, suggesting that it plays additional
roles beyond heat stress memory [59, 60]. The questions
of how FGT1 interacts with H3K4 hypermethylation and
whether it also plays a role in other stress memory phenomena remain to be investigated.
Nucleosome occupancy was also reported to be involved in priming stimulated by chemical agents. The
fasciata 2 mutant, which is defective in the CHROMATIN ASSEMBLY FACTOR-1 (CAF-1) histone assembly
complex, shows a molecular phenotype comparable to a
constitutive priming response. This is associated with
low nucleosome occupancy and high H3K4me3 at
primed genes [61]. Under non-sterile growth conditions,
the molecular priming is correlated with spurious activation of primed genes. The observed reduced nucleosome
occupancy is in agreement with the role of the evolutionarily conserved CAF-1 complex as a histone chaperone
depositing histone H3/H4 tetramers onto newly synthesized DNA during DNA replication [62].
Transcriptional memory was also reported in response
to desiccation stress treatment in A. thaliana [63–65].
Starting from transcriptome profiling, the authors identified genes that responded differently to a repeated desiccation stress than to the first desiccation stress. Besides
genes that showed a classic transcriptional memory
(enhanced re-induction upon recurring stress), other
classes of genes were identified that showed modified induction upon recurring desiccation—some showed enhanced repression, some loss of induction, and others
loss of repression [65]. The enhanced re-induction class
(e.g., RD29B and RAB18) has been characterized in most
detail [63], and this response has been found to result
from higher transcription correlated with sustained
H3K4me3 hypermethylation during the recovery period
[63, 66]. Moreover, paused transcription elongation was
identified as a probable mechanism; this might result

from the observed accumulation of RNA polymerase II
that was hyperphosphorylated in the serine 5 residue of
the C-terminal domain during recovery. The transcriptional memory and the associated chromatin and RNA
polymerase II modifications lasted for 5 to 7 days. A mutant in the ATX1 H3K4 methyltransferase gene [67, 68]
was defective in the amplitude of induction but not the
primability [63]. As this mutant retains residual H3K4
methylation at the memory genes, the interpretation of
this result is complicated. ABA signaling is necessary but
not sufficient for RD29B transcriptional memory [69]. The
mapping of cis elements that are required for this memory
identified two adjacent ABA-response elements (ABREs).
ABREs are bound by ABA-response element binding factors (ABFs). Interestingly, an abf2 abf3 abf4 triple mutant
displayed compromised induction of the memory genes
but not loss of memory, suggesting that transcriptional induction and memory are separable at the level of trans
factors [63, 69]. Thus, an additional factor yet to be identified is required for the memory. Interestingly, ABA treatment is sufficient as a priming stress cue, but as a
triggering stress cue, it is not sufficient to induce the transcriptional memory response.
Priming effectiveness across different stressors

Plants are exposed to various environmental stressors in
their natural environment, and priming by one type of
stressor can sometimes enhance plant responses to other
types of stress (cross-priming). For example, enhanced
immunity to bacterial pathogens can be induced by repeated moderate high or low temperature treatments or
by moderate salt treatments [70]. This cross-priming
correlates with the hyperinduction of pattern-triggered
immunity marker genes (WRKY53, FRK1, and NHL10)
after a triggering stress cue, as well as with increased accumulation of H3K14ac, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3, and it
requires the histone acetyltransferase HAC1. Interestingly,
prolonged stress treatment is not efficient as a priming
stimulus, indicating that the plant is able to distinguish
between repeated short and chronic stress exposure. This
cross-priming was effective for 7 days [70].
A crosstalk between different environmental stimuli
was also reported in salt-induced somatic stress memory
[71]. The P5CS1 gene shows transcriptional memory
(enhanced re-induction) in response to salt stress, and
this was associated with high H3K4me3. The same gene
was previously identified as a dehydration stress memory
gene [64, 65]. Promoter analysis revealed that separate cis
elements are required for salt and dehydration stress memory [71]. Interestingly, this salt-dependent memory requires
light signaling through the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5
(HY5) transcription factor, which binds the promoter
within the salt-memory element [71]; this suggests a higher
order integration of different environmental signals.

Besides the regulation at the level of nucleosome positioning and modification, chromatin-independent pathways also contribute to heat stress memory, involving
diverse microRNA- and protein stability-based mechanisms [53, 72–74]. For example, isoforms of the microRNA miR156 are induced after heat stress and repression
of their target genes is required for the sustained induction of memory genes and for physiological heat
stress memory [53]. As miR156 is an important regulator of developmental transitions, this signaling module may be used to integrate stress memory and plant
development.
Mechanisms of somatic stress memory

In summary, histone H3K4 methylation is frequently
correlated with different types of somatic stress memory
(Fig. 2). Interestingly, such a function may be conserved
in yeast and metazoans as a mark for transcriptional
memory [25, 75]. In addition, reduced nucleosome occupancy during priming has been found in several cases
and may be another factor that regulates chromatinbased stress memory [58, 61]. How both mechanisms
interact remains to be investigated.
Somatic stress memory is transient and its duration
has been studied using enhanced re-induction of gene
expression as a read-out. Across different types of abiotic stress priming, the duration was found to be surprisingly similar and lasted 5 to 7 days [63, 70, 71]. The
mechanism that limits this duration is currently unknown but may be an interesting target for extending
this memory. Duration limits may be connected with the
fact that maintaining the primed state requires the
allocation of resources (although fewer than would be
required to maintain a full defense response). With increasing duration, a point is reached beyond which
maintaining the primed state is more costly than new
adaptation, and thus resetting becomes advantageous.
Moreover, the likelihood that the stress will reoccur decreases with time because many stresses (such as heat
waves or attacks by herbivores) occur in clustered patterns. Maintaining a primed state is assumed to be less
costly than maintaining the full defense response, not
least because full responses often interfere with growth,
but few studies have sought to test this hypothesis. One
pioneering study on disease priming found that priming
does indeed provide a fitness advantage in a situation
where disease occurs, whereas it is slightly disadvantageous in a disease-free environment [76]. Studies aiming
to determine whether other types of somatic stress
memory provide a fitness advantage under field conditions will soon become possible because specific
regulators of these processes that do not have pleiotropic effects on growth and development are being
identified.

Fig. 2 Molecular features of somatic stress memory in response to abiotic stress cues. Somatic priming of plants by an abiotic (hyperosmotic, drought,
or heat) stress cue has common features that are displayed in the central box. Other properties have as yet only been implicated in a specific stress.
Notably, this apparent specificity is based on current knowledge rather than on explicit exclusion (right boxes, color-coding as indicated on the left).
HSF heat shock factor

Transgenerational inheritance of stress memory
Epialleles that are stable for hundreds of years have been
identified in plants. The peloria mutant of Linaria
vulgaris, which was identified by Linneus, provides a
particularly striking example. The flower of this mutant
is radially symmetric (whereas the wild-type flower is
dorsoventrally symmetric) because of a methylation
change in the promoter of a flower morphogenesis gene
[77]. The occasional recovery of revertants that have the
wild-type flower phenotype confirms that the phenotype
is independent of a DNA sequence mutation. Whether
similar epialleles are generated as an adaptation to
stress is a subject of intensive study and active discussion [78–80]. To clarify the interpretation of the reported results on potential transgenerational memory,
it has been instrumental to assemble a catalogue of criteria and experimental design principles that need to be
applied in order to demonstrate transgenerational inheritance [78, 81]. According to this definition, transgenerational epigenetic stress memory is meiotically stable
and extends for at least one stress-free generation. Importantly, it is independent of changes in DNA sequence.
Nevertheless, because the immediate progeny generation
develops on the mother plant, maternal (or even paternal)
effects must be taken into account. Thus, we propose to
distinguish transgenerational memory (which is detectable until at least the second stress-free generation)
from intergenerational stress memory (detectable in the
first stress-free generation; Box 1). Transgenerational
memory probably has an epigenetic basis, whereas this

may or may not be the case for intergenerational
memory.
Mechanisms of stress memory inheritance

Chromatin-based mechanisms of inheritance may involve heritable epialleles that have differential DNA
methylation [82–85]. An alternative possibility is that
histone modifications are inherited through either nucleosome recycling or the copying of modifications onto
newly incorporated histones. The extent to which both
processes take place is still under study [86]. Microscopic studies with tagged histones suggest an almost
complete replacement of H3 during gametogenesis and
fertilization [87]. Nevertheless, this leaves the possibility
that a few parental histones are retained or that modifications of the parental histones are copied onto the
newly incorporated histones [88]. Interestingly, resetting
the vernalized state of FLC during embryogenesis requires the activity of an H3K27 demethylase [89].
Mutants lacking the demethylase pass on the vernalized
state to their offspring, suggesting that histone-based
epigenetic states can, in principle, be transmitted through
meiosis and gametogenesis. In yeast, H3K9me at a transgene locus was stable over many mitotic generations in
the absence of the EPE1 demethylase [90, 91].
One of the first reports to suggest the existence of a
stress-induced transgenerational memory used a somatic
homologous recombination (SHR) reporter and demonstrated that SHR increased in the parental generation in
response to UV-C irradiation or treatment with the flg22

elicitor [92]. The rate of SHR remained elevated during
several unstressed generations, suggesting an epigenetic
basis. However, subsequent studies found that effects
were observed reliably only in the direct offspring of
stressed plants [81, 93, 94], confirming the presence of
an intergenerational stress memory.
A very recent study on hyperosmotic stress priming
confirmed intergenerational stress memory in the progeny of plants that were stressed during their vegetative
development for at least two successive generations [95].
This memory was, however, reset after one stress-free
generation, indicating that this is an environmental
adaptation that is rapidly lost in the absence of stress
[95]. In line with other studies, this intergenerational
stress memory appears to be inherited predominantly
through the mother. Wibowo et al. elegantly show that
paternal inheritance is inhibited by the activity of the
DNA glycosylase DEMETER (DME) in the male gametes,
and that the transmission of the memory through the
father is restored in dme mutants [95, 96]. RNA-mediated
DNA methylation and DNA-demethylation pathways
mediate the intergenerational memory in response to
hyperosmotic stress [95]. Indeed, discrete differentially
methylated regions (DMRs) that are associated with
this memory were identified by genome-wide methylation analysis. These regions are rich in transposable
element (TE)-related sequences. Two such DMRs in
the promoter of stress-related genes were associated
with a priming effect on gene expression that was
dependent on intact DNA methylation pathways [95].
Intergenerational or transgenerational stress memory
has also been found in response to biotic stresses [13, 97].
Priming in response to Pseudomonas syringae was shown
to persist into at least the progeny generation [98, 99].
One of the two studies found that the priming persisted
into the second stress-free generation, whereas the other
did not; notably, slightly different priming stimuli and
assay protocols were used. Intergenerational or transgenerational priming was evidenced by enhanced salicylic
acid-related defense gene induction and resistance to biotrophic pathogens [98] and by enhanced primability [99].
Mutants that are impaired in DNA methylation pathways
showed constitutive priming but an attenuated priming
response, suggesting that hypomethylated genes are involved in the priming response [98].
Transgenerational priming was also observed after caterpillar herbivory, a biotic stress that could be substituted for
by methyl jasmonate or mechanical damage [100]. Progeny
plants showed increased resistance (assayed by decreased
caterpillar growth) and increased priming of jasmonicacid-dependent defense responses. The priming was evident in the second stress-free generation and required
jasmonic acid perception and intact small interfering RNA
(siRNA) pathways. Thus, both salicylic-acid- and jasmonic-

acid-dependent defense responses are primed, and this
priming extends at least into the direct progeny generation.
This opens up the possibility that this principle could be
applied in an agronomic context by priming the parental
plants in order to produce more disease-resistant seeds.
Our mechanistic understanding of intergenerational or
transgenerational stress memory remains fragmented.
Genetic analysis suggests the involvement of DNA methylation and siRNA pathways in several cases. Nevertheless,
a contribution from other mechanisms, such as a memory
in form of metabolites or proteins deposited in the seed or
embryo, remains a possibility, especially where the memory is reset after one stress-free generation. For example,
the possible role of phytohormone levels in seeds has been
tested in some cases, but has not yet been substantiated
[95, 99, 100].

Conclusions and future directions
The hypothesis that traits that are acquired in one generation could be transmitted to following generations
was first put forward by Lamarck in the 19th century. In
the early 20th century, this incited Lysenko in socialist
Russia to attempt to grow wheat in unsuitable climates
with devastating effects. Subsequently, the proposed inheritance of acquired traits was viewed with a sound
measure of skepticism, until its popularity was revitalized
a few years ago by progress in the field of genomics and
epigenetics.
Here, we have reviewed mechanistic insights provided
by studies of the annual plant A. thaliana. One interesting
question is how these insights relate to stress memory in
perennials. In perennials, the vernalized state is reset
every year after flowering to restore the vernalization requirement for the next growing season [101, 102], but as
far as we know, stress memory has not been studied in
perennials that are close relatives of A. thaliana such as
Arabis alpina. Trees have an even more extreme life strategy in which an individual may live hundreds or even
thousands of years. Using cuttings of hybrid poplar from
different environments that were transplanted into a common garden, it has been shown that clone history affects
the response to drought in poplar [103]. However,
whether this variation in stress response involves genetargeted chromatin mechanisms has not been studied.
Besides numerous cases of somatic stress memory, a
number of well-documented cases of intergenerational
stress memory have been identified. From these, a picture emerges in which plants prime their direct offspring for a stress that they may encounter during their
lifetime. Given the short life cycle of rapid-cycling A.
thaliana accessions with more than one generation per
year, this may have an obvious adaptive value. In most
cases, the memory is reset after one stress-free generation. Correspondingly, it has been suggested that

transgenerational inheritance of priming over multiple generations may be disadvantageous in the highly fluctuating
conditions of a typical A. thaliana habitat [98, 104]. Stress
memory in plants with other life strategies remains to be
investigated. Similarly, insights into the molecular conservation of stress memory in crop species are scarce. It
should be mentioned, however, that the chemical priming of seeds to enhance the stress tolerance and pathogen
resistance of young plants after germination is a longstanding agronomic practice, referred to as seed priming.
A memory of heat stress has been demonstrated in temperate rice varieties and factors similar to those operating
in A. thaliana have been implicated [74]. It remains to
be investigated whether the priming mechanism is generally conserved in crop species.
Much evidence points towards a prominent role of
chromatin-based mechanisms in somatic and intergenerational stress memory, but this does not exclude the
involvement of other mechanisms. Progress will undoubtedly be made in unraveling the molecular basis of such
stress memory in the coming years. In particular, it will
be interesting to see whether different cases of stress
memory are encoded by the same mechanisms and
whether there are universal stress memory regulators. A
major topic will be the need to move beyond correlation
by demonstrating that targeted, gene-specific modifications to the epigenome do indeed lead to the anticipated
responses. In turn, this will identify key regulatory mechanisms that will allow tailored responses to the challenges
represented by the effects of climate change.
Understanding the underlying mechanisms in A.
thaliana will ultimately enable us to improve stress
tolerance in crop species. For example, one possibility
might be to exploit stress priming mechanisms to induce a constitutively primed state, thereby increasing a
crop’s ability to tolerate stress and disease without at
the same time incurring a penalty on biomass accumulation and yield.
