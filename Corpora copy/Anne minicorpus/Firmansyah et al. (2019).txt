Abstract. The threat and crisis of food due to global warming has a related with global
climate change. The threat of a decline in food production in various countries by climate
change triggers a long drought. The increase in temperature causes heat stress on the plant
which has an impact on the decline in land quality and others. Heat stress is often defined as an
increase in temperature for a certain period of time, which can cause irreversible damage to
plants, which generally occurs at temperatures of 10-15˚C above the threshold. Heat stress is a
major factor limiting crop productivity and adaptation, especially when extreme temperatures
coincide with the critical stage of plant growth.. Heat stress is a major factor limiting crop
productivity and adaptation, especially when extreme temperatures coincide with the critical
stage of plant growth. Excessive heat can disrupt by denaturing enzymes and damaging
metabolism so that changes occur in the morphological structure, phenology, physiology and
molecular plants.The response to increase in temperature of 5-10o C, makes plants produce a
unique protein called heat shock proteins (HSP). An increase in HSP production occurs when
plants experience a sudden or gradual increase in temperature. HSP is released when the stress
of exposed to plant . Under these conditions HSP is useful for protecting proteins and causes
resistant plants. The resistance obtained by heat shock is different from the resistance obtained
by rapid growth at moderately high temperatures. This difference is presumed by the presence
of HSP responses induced by heat stress. The HSP can play a role as a sign of gene stress and
activation and in regulating oxidation reactions in cells. Utilization of heat stress signaling in
food crops breeding can be used to development Wheat Tolerance to High Temperature.

1. Introduction
Temperature as an environmental factor can affect crop yields both physically and physiologically.
Physically, the temperature is the part that is affected by solar radiation and can be estimated based on
heat balance. Physiologically, the temperature can affect plant growth, photosynthesis, stomata
opening, and respiration. In addition, the temperature is one of the inhibitors in the physiological
process for crop production systems when the temperature of the plant is outside the lowest and
highest optimal temperatures.
Heat stress is often defined as an increase heat for a certain period of time, which can cause
irreversible damage to plants, which generally occurs at temperatures of 10-15˚C above the threshold
[38]. The stress factor is usually not only single but is a complex process because it involves several
determinants of growth. One example in the summer can cause damage tochlorophyll, low humidity,
dry soil and high temperatures. In addition, stress responses are very complex, involving various parts
of plants and involving stress hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene which are
transported to all parts of plants [42].

Heat stress is a major factor limiting crop productivity and adaptation, especially when extreme
temperatures coincide with the critical stage of plant growth. The rate of change in temperature and
the degree of resistance of plants to temperature is important to remember that plants have different
levels of heat resistance to survive periods of stress. In addition, the response of plants to heat stress
depends on adaptation to temperature, exposure interval and stage of tissue growth [5]. The response
to a sudden increase in temperature of 5-10 oC, makes plants produce a unique protein called heat
shock proteins (HSP). Increased HSP production occurs when plants experience an increase in
temperature either suddenly or gradually [34][44]. HSP, known as a heat shock protein, is released
when the plants body experiencing heat stress. Under these conditions, HSP is useful for protecting
proteins.
High temperatures disrupt and kill plants by denaturing their enzymes and damaging their
metabolism in various ways. Hot and dry weather also tends to cause water shortages in many plants
and stomata closure. Most plants have a reserve response that allows them to survive heat stress
Above a certain temperature of around 40° C in most plants that occupy four seasons, plant cells begin
to synthesize a special protein in sufficient quantities called protein heat shock (heat shock protein).
This heat shock protein may flank enzymes and other proteins and help prevent denaturation [4].
In tropical climate areas, excess radiation and high temperatures are often the limiting factors that
greatly affect plant growth and plant yields. High temperatures can cause crop damage, including
leaves, branches and stems. In addition there is an inhibition of ageing and root growth, fruit
discolouration and reduced production [15][22][50]. Likewise in temperate regions, heat stress has
been reported as one of the most important causes of reducing yields and production of dry matter in
plants, for example corn [14].
2. Signalling Morphology of Heat Stress
Heat killing temperature for plants is the temperature at 50% of plants die. This temperature varies
according to the type of plant. For higher plants that are growing, the highest temperature is reported
to be 60-120°C. However, this temperature lasts only for a very short period of time, namely during
the day, when growth is stopped temporarily [48].

Most plant tissues cannot survive long exposure at temperatures above 45 o C. Cells that are not
growing or dehydrated tissue (such as seeds and pollen) can survive at temperatures much higher than
vegetative cells. Tissues that are actively growing rarely survive at temperatures above 45 oC, but dry
seeds can withstand temperatures up to 120oC, and pollen grains from some species up to 70 oC.

Generally, only a single cell eukaryote can complete its life at temperatures above 50 oC and only
prokaryotes can divide and grow above 60 oC [48].
Responses due to high temperatures in plants can occur directly as in physiological processes while
the extreme damage is the death of cells, tissues, organs, and finally plants. This may differ from one
stage of phenology to another. For example, the effect of long-term heat stress causes delayed
germination or loss of vigour, resulting in reduced seed formation. Growth of coleoptiles in corn
decreases at 40°C and stops at 45°C. In seedlings also symptoms of burns occur at organ surface
temperatures reaching 48-50oC [56].
Burns or burn tissue generally occur on the trunk, branches and fruit due to the weak influence of
cooling by transpiration. High temperatures in shoot growth cause a reduction in weight at the length
of the first segment resulting in the premature death of plants [18]. High temperatures cause a decrease
in dry weight in shoots, relative growth rates and net assimilation rates of corn, barley and sugar cane,
although leaf area has minimal effect [1][53]. In wheat both seed weight and the number of seeds
appear to be very sensitive to heat stress with increasing temperature [11]. In environments with
intense sun radiation and high temperatures, plants avoid excessive heating of the leaves by reducing
the absorption of solar radiation. This adaptation is important in hot environments. Leaves transpire
near the upper limit of temperature tolerance. In such conditions, heat stress will cause evaporation of
distressed water and increased absorption energy so that it can damage the leaves.

Figure 1. The absorption and dissipation of energy from sunlight by the leaf [47]
The phenology of plants is greatly affected by heat, which is generally accelerated by temperatures
which cumulatively decrease yields. The heat accelerates phenology (plant development), the
acceleration of the process (phenology) will accelerate the transition from a certain phase to the next
phase, which results in reducing the size of plants or plant organs. Sugarcane plants that grow at high
temperatures show smaller segments, tillers increase, cook quickly and biomass decreases [8]. In
temperate and tropical lowlands, heat stress causes yield losses in Phaseolus vulgaris [15] and peanuts
[49] If the economic yield is part of the vegetative (biomass), heat will reduce the yield. If the harvest
is in the form of generative parts (seeds/fruit) then the negative impact of heat during the initial growth
phase will greatly reduce the time (shortening) of seed filling in cereals, followed by a reduction in the
number of seeds per grain, reducing the length of the seed filling period.
Heat stress combined with salinity generally has problems when the flowers bloom and the filling
of seeds of cereal plants that grow in temperate climates. For example, the extension of heat stress
when filling grain causes losses in wheat seeds up to 7% [16]. The same thing happened in the
formation of starch, protein and oil in corn kernels [57] and the quality of cereal grains affected by
heat stress[28].

3. Signaling Physiology of Heat Stress
Temperature as an environmental factor that can affect physical and physiological plant production.
Physically,the temperature is the part that is affected by sunlight radiation. Physiologically, the
temperature can affect plant growth, photosynthesis, stomata opening, and respiration. In addition, the
temperature can be one of the inhibitors in the physiological process for crop production systems if the
plant temperature is outside the optimal temperature both low and high temperatures. Heat stress
affects all aspects of plant processes like germination, growth, development, reproduction and yield
[19][31][30].
Heat stress differentially influences the constancy of various proteins, membranes, RNA species
and cytoskeleton structures, and alters the efficiency of enzymatic reactions in the cell for which the
major physiological processes obstacle and creates metabolic imbalance (Ruelland and Zachowski,
2010). It is believed by some workers that night high temperatures are major limiting factors, whereas
others argued that day and night high temperatures do not affect the plant independently. The diurnal
means temperature is a superior forecaster of plant response to high temperature with day temperature
having a secondary role [38]
An increase in leaf temperature during the day in a dry area causes plants to experience a lack of
water due to high irradiation from sunlight. Plant water status is the most important component under
changes in threshold temperature [29] Temperature stress also affects plant growth in greenhouses.
Low air velocity and high humidity reduce the rate of leaf cooling. In general, plants tend to maintain
the stability of the water status in the tissue without regard to temperature when the humidity is
sufficient. However, high temperatures are very damaging and water is a limiting factor [27]. In field
conditions, heat stress is often associated with reduced water availability [45]
Air temperature or soil temperature affect plants through metabolic processes in the body of the
plant, which are reflected in various properties such as growth rate, seed dormancy, germination,
flowering, fruit growth maturation/maturation of plant tissues or organs. Plant responses to
temperature differ depending on the type of plant, variety, stage of plant growth, type of organ /tissue
[47]. Plants based on physiological functions are grouped into 3 groups, namely CAM, C3 and C4.
Plants with open stomata at night and closed during the day are called Crassulacean Acid
Metabolism (CAM). The difference in vapour pressure or VPD (Vapor pressure difference) from the
leaves to the air causes very low transpiration at night when the leaves and the air cools. CAM plants
can get 1 g of dry weight using only 125 g of water. A ratio of 3-5 times greater than the ratio for C3
plants. CAM plants, such as Opuntia and Sempervivum can withstand tissue temperatures of 600-650C
in the heat of the sun in summer. Because CAM plants keep their stomataclosed during the day, CAM
plants cannot be cooled by transpiration but releases heat from solar radiation by re-emitting longwave radiation (infra red) and losing heat by conduction and convection.
C3 and C4 plants affected by heat stress rely on transpiration to reduce leaf temperature. Leaf
temperature can immediately rise 4-50C above the ambient air temperature in bright sunlight before
noon. Lack of groundwater causes partial closure of stomata or when high relative humidity decreases
the potential for transpiration. Moderate temperature stress slows overall growth. Large respiration is
associated with high agronomic outcomes. Heat stress interferes with the movement of water, ions and
organic solutions across the plant membrane [21].
High temperatures reduce membrane stability while the stability of various cell membranes is
important at hightemperature stresses, such as when cold and freezing. Excessive exchange of
substances from membranes at high temperatures is associated with loss of physiological function. In
oleander (Nerium oleander), the impact of high temperature is related to the higher degree of
saturation of the membrane fatty acids so that the membrane is less liquid. The function of a cellular
membrane that is sustained under stress is important for photosynthesis and respiration [3].
Photosynthesis and respiration are inhibited at high temperatures, but when the temperature rises,
the rate of photosynthesis decreases sharply before the respiration rate. Treshow (1970) reports that
photosynthesis is an important reaction that is affected by heat. Photosynthesis occurs in a temperature

range of 10-30°C depending on the climate of the plant. Above the temperature of 10˚C
photosynthesis will increase with increasing temperature, and will experience a decrease above 30˚C.
Respiration generally occurs in the temperature range of 5-25˚C, increases at 30-35˚C and slows above
35˚C [20]. Heat stress reduces chemical reactions, gas solubility, mineral absorption and water uptake,
disrupts the electron transfer system in photosynthesis and increases oxidative damage to membrane
lipids[6].
4. Signalling Biochemical of Heat Stress
Heat stress causes oxidative stress, which is a condition when the amount of free radicals in the body
exceeds the capacity to neutralize it and consequently the intensity of the oxidation process of normal
body cells becomes higher and causes more damage. Reaction of activated oxygen species (AOS)
including singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide radical (O2-)hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl
radical (OH-) are symptoms of cell damage due to high temperatures [26]. AOS causes lipid
membranes to lose the ability to regulate the exchange of substances in cells [58]
The Energy needed for biological functions in aerobic organisms is produced in the mitochondria
through the electron transfer chain. In addition to AOS reactions, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) also
have the potential to cause cellular damage. ROS can damage DNA, RNA and protein, which
contribute to the physiology of ageing. ROS are produced as normal products of cell metabolism.
Specifically, one of the main causes of oxidative damage is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which is
converted from superoxide leaked from mitochondria. A study shows that accumulation of ROS can
reduce the resistance of organisms due to oxidative damage. Specifically, oxidative damage can affect
mitochondrial efficiency and increase the rate of ROS production. Oxidative damage and its effect on
ageing depend on the type of tissue in which the damage occurs [26]
Decreased antioxidant activity in the tense tissue shows a higher amount of AOS when the
organism is gripped [10]. Protection against oxidative stress is an important component in determining
the survival of plants in heat stress. Available data shows. thatseveral molecules can cause an increase
in the antioxidant capacity of cells [12]
SOD is a preventive anti oxidant made by the body to prevent excessive free radicals in the body.
The enzyme catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) repair the damage effects that function as a
catalyst to change the dismutation reaction from superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen
molecules. However, peroxide can survive in cells. While ROS is produced as a product of normal
cellular function. Excessive amounts can cause damage. The body produces free radical compounds
through the process of phosphorylation. During the oxidative phosphorylation process, O2 is reduced
to H2O by the addition of 4 electrons, so that superoxide anion radicals are formed which then become
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the SOD enzyme.
Plants have developed a series of detoxification systems to fight AOS both enzymatically and nonenzymatically, thus protecting cells from oxidative damage [41]. SOD enzymes in plants affect a
number of physiological phenomena including the elimination of H202, toxic oxidation of reducers,
biosynthesis and degradation of lignin in cell walls, enzyme catabolism, defense against injury,
defense against pathogenic or insect attack and some respiratory processes [43] More specifically,
APX activation is related to the appearance of physiological damage caused by temperature stress [29]
The process of phosphorylation in the mitochondria causes 1 O2 molecule to be reduced by 4
electrons together with H + ions to form 2 H2O molecules. If the electrons reducing O2 are less than
4, the phosphorylation process is incomplete and free radicals are formed. SOD enzymes work can be
seen in the number of lipid peroxidation products per organelle. If the activity of the enzyme increases
it will cause lipid oxidation products to decrease [13].

Figure 2. The mechanism of cell resistance to oxidative stress that helps stabilize fatty acids in tense
environmental conditions [41]
Superoxide radical compounds are regularly synthesized in chloroplasts and mitochondria and
some parts are also produced in microbodies. O2-flushing by superoxide dismutase (SOD) results in
the production of H2O2 lost by APX (ascorbate peroxidase) or CAT (catalase). SOD is a class of
enzymes that catalyzes oxygen and hydrogen into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Thus, SOD is an
important antioxidant defense in cells. Almost all cells are exposed to oxygen, but both O2- and H2O2
are not OH- or toxic compounds formed by a combination of O2- and H2O2 in the presence of Fe2 +
and Fe3 + traces by the Haber-Weiss reaction. OH- can damage chlorophyll, protein, DNA, fat and
other important macromolecular, thus affecting plant metabolism and limiting growth and yield [41].
5. Heat Shock Protein
The response to a sudden increase in temperature of 5-100C, makes plants produce a unique protein
called heat shock proteins (HSP). Increased HSP production occurs when plants experience an
increase in temperature either suddenly or gradually [34]. HSP, known as a heat shock protein, is
released when the body is hot. Under these conditions, HSP is useful for protecting proteins. HSP is
found in all living things.
Most of the function of HSP is to help cells survive heat stress by acting as chaperons. Heat Shock
Proteins are a group of proteins in living cells that can be found in all phases of the development of
these living things. This protein is active when stimulated by various forms of stress such as oxidative
stress, heat, cold, inflammation and oxygenation disorders in cells. Under normal conditions, HSP is
also commonly found in cells as a companion. Heat stress causes many cell proteins that function as
enzymes or structural components to unfold or fold folded incorrectly. This results in a loss of
structure and correct enzyme activity. HSP induction is a response to the temperature observed in all
organisms ranging from bacteria to humans [51].
The role of HSP as a companion in the formation of proteins. To support the action of ribosomes
along with RNA molecules, an amino acid chain is built to form a new protein molecule. This chain is
protected from unwanted interactions with other cytoplasmic molecules with HSP and chaperonin
molecules until they have successfully completed their cycle into proteins. HSP acts as a chaperonin
(molecular companion) and serves to achieve the correct folds of collected protein and to prevent
incorrect folds of protein. This all facilitates proper cell function at high temperatures. Chaperons are
proteins that help fold / unload noncovalent folds and attach /release proteins with other
macromolecular structures. Chaperons function primarily if there is an error in protein folding and
does not function if the structure of the protein formed has normal biological functions [34]

The protein binds to the chaperone molecule and starts the folding process. After folding and
translating the genetic code by tRNA into the amino acid sequence, the protein is released from the
chaperon and transferred to the Golgi apparatus. If the protein assembly is incomplete, then the wrong
folded protein will bind to the chaperons and be in the RE. This landfill in RE serves as a signal for the
formation of a new chaperon. Proteins that are wrongly folded are removed and degraded in the
cytoplasm [9]
Plants and most other organisms make HSPs of different sizes in response to rising temperatures .
Most HSPs synthesized by eukaryote organisms have five different structures namely HSP100,
HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, Small HSP (SmHSP) found in the nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplast,
endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol [51]. The molecular weight of HSP varies from 15-104 kDa. HSP
molecular weight is characterized by high sequence homologues in plants [54]
HSP 100 is formed continuously but is also regulated by environmental pressures. These proteins
generally function to protect protein denaturation and protein formation [55] HSP 104 in Arabidopsis
and yeast play an important role in resistance to heat stress [28]. HSP 101 in Arabidopsis influences
growth during the recovery period [52]. It has been found that the homogenised Arabidopsis HSP101
is involved as a link in the plastids in the formation of thylakoids and as a temperature resistance for
chloroplasts during hot strikes [32]
SmHSP is also produced under conditions of environmental stress and several stages of
development (embryogenesis, germination, growth and maturation of fruit pollen). SmHSP
encourages gene change. This shows the important role of proteins in abiotic stress [17]. The degree
of smHSP formation depends on the temperature and duration of the stress period [46]. SmHSP shows
heterogeneous structure according to its molecule, center of gravity and isoelectric stability [23]. After
heat stress, smHSP is stable with half -life after 30-50 hours. This shows that smHSP might be
important for recovery [46].
All cells contain companion molecules that are formed together and function like HSP. This
companion is called a heat shock cognate protein. However, when cells are exposed to heat but are not
damaged, the synthesis of HSPs dramatically increases while the translational continuity of other
proteins is dramatically reduced or completely stopped. The response to this heat shock is preceded by
a specific transcription factor (HSF) that acts on HSP mRNA transcription.
Cells that are induced to synthesize HSP exhibit better temperature resistance and can withstand
gripping conditions and otherwise damage. Some HSPs are not unique to high-temperature stress. HSP
is also affected by stresses or very different environmental conditions, including water shortages, ABA
treatment, wounds, low temperatures, and salinity. Thus, cells that were previously exposed to one
stress may get cross-protection against other stresses. The case of tomatoes given heat exposure (48
hours at 38oC) supports the accumulation of HSP and protects cells for 21 days from cooling at 20 oC
The mechanism that occurs in HSP is still mysterious, although some roles in plant cells have been
ascribed to HSP. Many studies have confirmed that the HSP chaperone molecule functions as a protein
that keeps cells under heat stress. Some evidence has been shown that resistance to heat is directly
related to the synthesis of HSP accumulation [2]
When there is no heat stress, the heat shock factor (HSF) is a monomer that is unable to bind DNA
and direct transcription. The stress causes the associated HSF monomer to become a trimer which is
then able to bind to a specific unique element in DNA called a heat shock element (HSE) or heat
shock element. Once bound to trimeric HSE HSF is phosphorylated and promotes HSP mRNA
transcription. HSP70 binds to HSF and causes HSF / HSE to break down. HSF is then recycled into
the HSF monomer form. Thus the action of HSF causes HSP to accumulate until it becomes abundant
enough to bind HSF which leads to the cessation of HSP mRNA production [39] Two alternative ways
could be proposed to enhance HSP70 concentration in plant tissues. The first is subjecting plants to
heat shock, so that concentration of the inducible form of HSP70 increases and harvesting the plants
when protein concentration is maximum.Heat shock can be administered in the field by means of heat
producing machines. The second is overexpressing HSP70 in plants by genetic transformation [36]

Figure 3. Induction and Regulation of Heat Shock Protein due to environmental stress [39]

6. Potential Utilization of Heat ShockProtein for Tropical Wheat Breeding
Wheat genetic improvement through breeding programs in Indonesia is initiated by introducing the
elite lines from various countries which are considered suitable for tropical agroecosystems in
Indonesia because Indonesia does not have local germplasm. A broad genetic diversity is needed to get
wheat. varieties adaptive to tropical conditions in Indonesia. Increasing genetic diversity of wheat is
conducted through cross-breeding and mutation (seeds and somaclonal variation). Not all types of
wheat can be grown in Indonesia, only Triticum aestivum that can be developed at areas of > 1,000 m
asl. The development of tropical wheat at < 1,000 m asl should be supported by breeding programs
initiated by forming the population until releasing the varieties with shuttle breeding methods [37].
Strategies to maintain wheat plants against high temperature stress need to be studied to support
genetic improvement through a tropical wheat breeding program. According to Dolferus et al [7],
wheat crop stages that are most critical of abiotic stress are reproductive stages. Therefore, this
stadium needs to be considered for studying plant turnover against abiotic stresses. Tropical wheat
breeding programs that have been running and show good results are breeding through conventional
crosses and mutations (seed mutationsand somaclonal variations) [36].
Information regarding the genetic basis of heat tolerance is generally scarce, though the use of
traditional plant breeding protocols and contemporary molecular biological techniques, including
molecular marker technology and genetic transformation, have resulted in genetic characterization
and/or development of plants with improved heat stress tolerance. Constitutive expression of specific
proteins has been shown to enhance heat tolerance. In addition to the knowledges concerning the
expression of HSPs/ chaperones and manipulation of HSF gene expression, other transgenic plants
with varying degrees of heat tolerance have been produced. Unpredictably, however, such experiments
have been quite limited compared to the experiments aimed at engineering drought, salt or cold stress
tolerance [20]
Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs)/HSP20 are molecular chaperones that protect plants by
preventing protein aggregation during abiotic stress conditions, especially heat stress. Due to global
climate change, high temperature is emerging as a major threat to wheat productivity. Thus, the
identification of HSP20 and analysis of HSP transcriptional regulation under different abiotic stresses
in wheat would help in understanding the role of these proteins in abiotic stress tolerance.results
showed that the identified TaHSP20 genes play an important role under different abiotic stress
conditions. Thus, the results illustrate the complexity of the TaHSP20 gene family and its stress

regulation in wheat and suggest that SSHs as attractive breeding targets for improvement of the heat
tolerance of wheat [33].
7. Conclusion
Heat stress is defined as an increase in temperature beyond the threshold level for a certain period of
time, which can cause irreversible damage to plant growth and development. In general, usually
ranges from 10-15˚C above the threshold. Heat stress causes changes in the morphological,
phenological, physiological and molecular structure of plants. The response to a temperature rise of 510 ° C suddenly causes plants to produce a unique group of proteins called heat shock proteins that
function to help cells survive heat stress.Utilization of heat stress signaling in food crops breeding can
be used to development Wheat Tolerance to High Temperature. Knowledge relating to molecular basis
and mechanism of tolerance is considered to pave the way for engineering plants that can withstand
heat stress. In addition, greater emphasis on heat stress management is obligatory for heat tolerance
features, molecular cloning, and characterization of genes.
