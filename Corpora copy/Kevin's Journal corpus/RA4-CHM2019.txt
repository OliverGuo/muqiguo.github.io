In Brief 
Commensal-derived antigens may contribute to autoimmunity by coincidentally mimicking immune-targeted self-structures. Ruff et al. report that human autoreactive lymphocytes and autoantibodies cross-react with homologous regions expressed by the human gut commensal Roseburia intestinalis. Pathogenic APS-generated autoantibodies target bacterial DNA methyltransferase. Gavage of susceptible mice with R. intestinalis triggers autoimmune pathologies.

SUMMARY 
Given the immense antigenic load present in the microbiome, we hypothesized that microbiota mimo-topes can be a persistent trigger in human autoim-munity via cross-reactivity. Using antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a model, we demonstrate cross-reactivity between non-orthologous mimotopes expressed by a common human gut commensal, Roseburia intestinalis (R. int), and T and B cell autoe-pitopes in the APS autoantigen b2-glycoprotein I (b2GPI). Autoantigen-reactive CD4+ memory T cell clones and an APS-derived, pathogenic monoclonal antibody cross-reacted with R. int mimotopes. Core-sequence-dependent anti-R. int mimotope IgG titers were signi.cantly elevated in APS patients and corre-lated with anti-b2GPI IgG autoantibodies. R. int immu-nization of mice induced b2GPI-speci.c lymphocytes and autoantibodies. Oral gavage of susceptible mice with R. int induced anti-human b2GPI autoantibodies and autoimmune pathologies. Together, these data support a role for non-orthologous commensal-host cross-reactivity in the development and persistence of autoimmunity in APS, which may apply more broadly to human autoimmune disease. 
INTRODUCTION 
Commensal microorganisms chronically colonize host barrier sites and impact a broad range of human physiology (Cho and Blaser, 2012). Commensal-host interactions with the mucosal and systemic immune systems have evolved over millennia (O¡¯Hara and Shanahan, 2006). Microbial antigens are continu-ously sampled by the mucosal immune system and presented to adaptive immune cells that can mount local and systemic responses (Hand et al., 2012; Hegazy et al., 2017; Ladinsky et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2016). Commensal-host immune interactions are implicated in the development of autoimmunity via bystander activation, cross-reactivity, dual antigen recep-tors, and epitope spreading (Ost and Round, 2018; Ruff and Kriegel, 2015). Because the particular antigens presented by innate immune cells to antigen-specifc T cells are dictated by polymorphisms in major histocompatibility (MHC) genes, host-commensal cross-reactivity may contribute to the development and persistence of human autoimmunity in genetically predis-posed individuals. Given the enormous antigenic load of the human gut microbiome, which is encoded by over 9.8 million non-redundant genes (Li et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2010), we hypothesized that chronic exposure of the gut immune system to non-orthologous, commensal mimotopes generates and sus-tains human autoimmune disease via cross-reactivity. 
We utilized antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a model of systemic autoimmunity with well-characterized autoepitopes to test for commensal mimotope cross-reactivity. The common autoantigen b2-glycoprotein I (b2GPI), also known as apolipopro-tein H, is targeted in the majority of APS patients (Ruiz-Irastorza et al., 2010). It contains fve domains and circulates at high levels in human plasma (Lozier et al., 1984; Polz and Kostner, 1979). T cell-dependent autoantibodies against b2GPI lead to autoim-mune clotting events and obstetric complications (Garcia and Erkan, 2018; Giannakopoulos and Krilis, 2013). Widespread thrombotic events can be lethal and occur also in patients with other systemic rheumatic diseases such as lupus (Garcia and Er-
kan, 2018; Giannakopoulos and Krilis, 2013; Rauch et al., 2018). A thoroughly characterized CD4+ T cell epitope in domain V (DV) of b2GPI is p276-290 (KVSFFCKNKEKKCSY), which is restricted by the human leukocyte antigen polymorphism HLA-DRB4*0103 (serotype DR53) (Arai et al., 2001; Kuwana et al., 2005). The major B cell autoepitope resides in domain I (DI) of b2GPI, the arginine-rich R39-R43 (RGGMR) sequence, and is strongly asso-ciated with thrombosis (de Laat et al., 2005, 2006; Ioannou et al., 2007; Iverson et al., 1998; Mahler et al., 2016; Pericleous et al., 2015). Focusing on commensals with mimotopes to both T cell (p276-290) and B cell (R39-R43) epitopes within b2GPI, we identifed the prevalent, immunogenic human gut commensal Roseburia intestinalis (R. int) as a cross-reactive trigger in APS patients. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence supporting T and B cell cross-reactivity between human b2GPI autoepitopes and R. int mimotopes. We show that human, gut-tropic, b2GPI-reactive memory CD4+ Th1 cell clones cross-react with R. int and mimotope peptides. Further, an APS-derived, pathogenic autoepitope-specifc antibody binds to a mimotope in a bacterial DNA methyltransferase expressed by R. int (R. int DNMT). Consistent with these fndings, APS patients have signif-icantly elevated levels of anti-R. int DNMT IgG, which positively correlate with anti-b2GPI IgG and are dependent on the core sequence based on mutagenesis studies. Moreover, immuniza-tion of BALB/c mice with R. int induces autoepitope-specifc cross-reactivity to human b2GPI. Finally, oral gavage of R. int into the spontaneous APS mouse model, (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice, induced signifcantly elevated anti-human b2GPI IgG autoantibodies and thrombotic events. These proof-of-concept studies support cross-reactivity between non-orthologous commensal mimotopes and autoepitopes in genetically suscep-tible individuals as a potential mechanism sustaining chronic autoimmunity in humans. 


RESULTS 
APS Patients Exhibit Signs of Gut In.ammation with Systemic Adaptive Immune Responses to b2-Glycoprotein I Mimotope-Expressing Roseburia intestinalis 
We aligned the HLA-DRB4*0103 (DR53)-restricted b2GPI-immu-nodominantCD4+T cellepitopep276-290(KVSFFCKNKEKKCSY) (Arai et al., 2001; Kuwana et al., 2005) and the major APS B cell autoepitope in b2GPI, R39-R43 (RGGMR) (de Laat et al., 2005; Ioannou et al., 2007; Iverson et al., 1998) to bacterial proteins in non-redundant protein databases (Altschul et al., 1990). Candidate sequences were cross-referenced to identify human commensal gut bacteria containing homology to both of these well-defned T and B cell autoepitopes. Excluding pathogens that are expected to represent mainly transient stimuli, we identifed R. int as a common, human colonic bacterium contain-ing proteins with highly homologous amino acid sequences to the CD4+ Tcell b2GPI-immunodominant epitope p276-290 (GenBank: EEU99424.1) in DV and the core region (R39-R43) of the major B cell autoepitope in DI of b2GPI (NCBI Reference Sequence: WP_118597735.1) (Figure 1A). Further, the B cell mimotope was predicted by in silico modeling to be exposed, indicating a potential antibody-binding site within R. int DNMT (Figure 1B). 
We enrolled 15 subjects positive for persistent moderate-to-high-titer b2GPI IgG autoantibodies (11 APS patients and 4 indi-viduals at risk for APS, defned as APS hereafter) and 20 healthy donors (defned as normal healthy donors [NHD] hereafter). Study subjects donated fecal samples, whole blood, and plasma at up to three longitudinal visits separated by 1 month each to capture microbial and immune marker variability over time. Health status, medications, 24-h diet histories, and APS-relevant HLA and auto-antibody status were collected over time (Tables 1 and S1). 
To determine overall gut microbial community structure, sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) V4 region was per-formed on fecal DNA (Cullen et al., 2015; Kozich et al., 2013). Compared to NHDs on average and across time, overall taxon-omy, alpha diversity as measured by Shannon-Weiner diversity index, and beta diversity as measured by principal-coordinate analysis of weighted UniFrac distances were not different in APS patients (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1A¨CS1E). Similarly, the rela-tive abundance of Roseburia at the genus level was not signif-cantly different in APS patients (Figure S1F), supporting its broad prevalence in human gut microbiomes. Next, we determined IgA coating of the gut microbiota using fuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). IgA coating varied across time (Figure S1G) with a trend toward being increased in APS patients compared to NHDs (Figure S1H). Furthermore, sorting of IgA-coated frac-tions followed by 16S rRNA sequencing, so called IgA-seq (Palm et al., 2014), was performed on a limited cohort. IgA-coated fractions differed in taxonomy with signifcantly lower alpha diversity and different beta diversity in APS patients compared to NHDs (Figures 1E, 1F, and S2). IgA coating of the genus Roseburia was not different by IgA-coating index (ICI) (Fig-
ure S3), but this method does not capture species-specifc alter-ations in IgA coating. Using R. int species-specifc qPCR primers (Figure S4A), R. int was detected in 13 of 15 APS patients and positive in 86.7% (n = 44) of all visits. Similarly, R. int was present in 18 of 20 healthy donors and positive in 88.6% (n = 48) of all visits (Figure S4B). These data support that while gut microbial community structure is not signifcantly different in APS compared to NHD, gut mucosal IgA targets are contracted in APS patients and that R. int is widely prevalent in the gut micro-biome of our cohort. 
We next examined if subclinical intestinal and corresponding systemic infammation is present in APS patients, with the hypothesis that the contracted mucosal IgA response may asso-ciate with a more pronounced systemic IgG response toward certain gut microbiota. Using the surrogate fecal marker of infammation, calprotectin (Berstad et al., 2000; Konikoff and Denson, 2006), and a marker of intestinal-associated systemic infammation, lipocalin-2 (Chassaing et al., 2012; Vijay-Kumar et al., 2010), we compared signs of infammation between APS and NHD. For fecal calprotectin measurements, we excluded individuals taking proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-infammatory drugs because these interventions are associ-ated with increased fecal calprotectin levels (Poullis et al., 2003; Tibble et al., 1999). Fecal calprotectin was signifcantly elevated in APS compared to NHD and did not change across time within individuals (Figures 1G and S4C). Moreover, plasma lipocalin-2 was signifcantly elevated in APS patients and did not differ across time (Figures 1H and S4D). These data support that chronic, subclinical intestinal and peripheral infammation is pre-sent in APS patients, possibly allowing for cross-reactive im-mune responses to commensal bacteria to spread systemically.

To determine if R. int is recognized outside of the gut, we during the late-exponential growth phase (Figure S4E). Using determined the highest expression of both R. int-mimotope-con-whole R. int or the soluble fraction of lysates from cultures grown taining genes. Both genes displayed variable expression by to late-exponential phase, we examined peripheral antibody and qPCR throughout a 24-h growth curve, with maximal expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses to R. int. 
Cell Host & Microbe 26, 100¨C113, July 10, 2019 103 Using bacterial FACS, we determined plasma antibody coating of R. int. APS patients had signifcantly higher ratios of anti-



R. int IgG than anti-R. int IgM or IgA, respectively (Figures 1I and 1J). These ratios did not change over time (Figures S4F and S4G). Moreover, PBMCs from HLA-DRB4*01 (DR53)-posi-tive APS subjects but not HLA-DRB4*01 (DR53)-negative APS or NHDs vigorously proliferated in response to R. int proteins (Figure 1K). These data extend recent data that R. int is capable of eliciting a peripheral immune response in humans (Hegazy et al., 2017). Furthermore, these data support that T cells from APS patients respond systemically to R. int in an HLA-dependent manner. Together with an IgG isotype-skewed response toward 
R. int, these results suggest adaptive T and B cell reactivity against this species in APS patients as occurs also toward other Roseburia species in autoimmune-prone humans (Paun et al., 2019). To investigate mimotope cross-reactivity in APS, we examined memory CD4+ T cells specifc for the b2GPI-immuno-dominant epitope p276-290. 
b2GPI-Reactive Memory CD4+ Th1 Cells from APS Patients Cross-React with the Corresponding R. int Mimotope 
To investigate human CD4+ T cell cross-reactivity with R. int,we cloned b2GPI-specifc T cells from HLA-DRB4*01+ APS PBMCs

These clones secrete (B) GM-CSF (n = 10, p < 0.023) and (C) IFN-g (n = 8, p < 0.001) in the culture supernatant 72 h post-antigen stimulation.

Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) plus rhIL-2 serve as positive control. Clones secrete (E) GM-CSF (n = 4, p < 0.002) and (F) IFN-g (n = 3, p < 0.0001). CPM measured by 3[H]-thymidine incorporation with averages of triplicates shown. Tetramer proliferation was determined using ATP luminescence. Fold increase determined by dividing the average of triplicates from individual clones by the average of the unstimulated (¡®¡®no antigen¡¯¡¯) clones in relative light units (RLU).

using a T cell library method (Geiger et al., 2009). We sorted CD4+, CD45RA , CD45RO+, CD25 , b7 integrin+ memory T cells from patients into CCR6+/ popu-lations. Integrin b7 is a marker of mu-
cosa-homing lymphocytes, and CCR6 is 
enriched in Th17 cells linked with human autoimmunity (Cao et al., 2015; Farstad et al., 1996; Geiger et al., 2009). We identifed b2GPI-reactive T cells in both the CCR6-and CCR6+ populations (Figures S5A and S5B). b2GPI p276-290-reactive gut homing, CCR6 memory T cells but not CCR6+ clones cross-reacted with the R. int p276-290 mimotope (Figures 2A). The cross-reactive clones displayed a Th1-like phenotype, as shown by secretion of IFN-g and GM-CSF (Fig-
ures 2B and 2C), which has also been linked to a pathogenic Th1 response in human autoimmunity (Noster et al., 2014). We noted increased IL-2 and IL-4 in b2GPI p276-290-stimulated clones but not mimotope clones, with no signifcant increase in IL-10 or IL-17A, consistent with the lack of CCR6 expression in cross-reactive clones (Figures S5C¨CS5F). These fndings support peptide cross-reactivity between the disease-relevant T cell-b2GPI DV peptide and the R. int mimotope. Cross-reactivity of these particular clones occurred within the Th1 and not Th17 pool, the former having been previously linked to APS (Benagiano et al., 2017; Salem et al., 2015). 
To further investigate APS CD4+ T cell cross-reactivity, we synthesized a DRB4*0103 MHC class II tetramer specifc for b2GPI p276-290. To limit disulfde bond formation when produc-ing the tetramer, we substituted cytosine at position 13 with alanine (C13A, KVSFFCKNKEKKASY). Tetramer-specifc CD4+, CD45RA , CD45RO+, CD25 , and CCR6+/ memory T cells were isolated by FACS. Tetramer-positive cells were expanded and tested for reactivity to both the tetramer peptide and to whole heat-killed R. int, which we used to determine if physiolog-ically processed peptides presented on MHC II would be suff-cient to induce cross-reactivity similar to PBMCs shown in Figure 2A. We identifed tetramer-positive clones that showed signifcant responses to R. int (Figure 2D). Tetramer-positive, 


R. int cross-reactive clones showed a similar Th1-like (IFN-g + and GM-CSF+) phenotype consistent with the phenotype of clones identifed using the T cell library method (Figures 2E, 2F, and S5G¨CS5J). These data from two different approaches confrmed that APS-derived cross-reactive memory CD4+ T cells have the capacity to produce proinfammatory cytokines and are polarized toward a Th1 response in vitro. 
A Pathogenic, APS-Derived b2GPI R39-R43-Speci.c Autoantibody Cross-Reacts with R. int DNMT 
To test autoantibody cross-reactivity, we cloned two APS-derived, lupus anticoagulant (LA)-inducing autoantibodies, pre-viously demonstrated to bind to b2GPI DI, as full-length human IgG1 antibodies (Dienava-Verdoold et al., 2011; Pelkmans et al., 2013). Clone P1-117 binds to a discontinuous DI-DII epitope containing the major R39-R43 epitope, whereas clone P2-6 binds to an unrelated DI epitope outside of the R39-R43 sequence (Dienava-Verdoold et al., 2011; Pelkmans et al., 2013). We confrmed P1-117 DI interaction by ELISA and bio-layer interferometry (Figures 3Aand S6A¨CS6C). Supporting cross-reactivity of an R39-R43-specifc mAb with R. int,we found that P1-117, but not P2-6, bound to R. int lysates similarly to serum from mice immunized with R. int (Figure 3B). Finally, we show that P1-117 bound to the R. int DNMT mimotope compared to a mutant version with RGGMR substituted with al-anines (R. int DNMTD122-126)(Figures 3Cand S6D). To confrm the specifcity of these interactions using bio-layer interferom-etry, we screened recombinant human insulin (rhInsulin) as an unrelated human autoantigen, which is typically employed in polyreactivity assays (Tiller et al., 2007). Compared to b2GPI or R. int DNMT, we found very weak interactions between rhIn-sulin and P1-117, as refected by a KD value of 5,800 nM (Figure S6E). 
To further validate the pathogenic nature of LA-inducing P1-117, we performed in vitro assays testing the ability of P1-117 to induce human placental trophoblast abnormalities, which is one of the mechanisms how b2GPI autoantibodies mediate obstetric complications in pregnant women with APS such as pre-eclampsia and abortions (Abrahams et al., 2017; Garcia and Erkan, 2018; Giannakopoulos and Krilis, 2013). P1-117 reduced trophoblast migration by 67.5% ¡À 3.6% when compared to media control, and by 60.0% ¡À 5.9% when compared to IgG isotype control (Figure 3D). This reduction in the ability of trophoblast cells to migrate was not due to the P1-117 mAb affecting cell viability (P1-117 viability 96.6% ¡À 1.67). Using an in vitro model of spiral artery transfor-mation (Alvarez et al., 2015), the presence of P1-117 disrupted trophoblast-endothelial interactions and tube stability, result-ing in a 35.7 ¡À 2.8% decrease in the number of tube-like struc-tures when compared to media control, and also a signifcant 
40.1 ¡À 2.4% decrease in tube-like structures when compared to IgG isotype control (Figures 3E and 3F). Together, these results support that P1-117 is pathogenic and cross-reactive with R. int, interacting with the RGGMR core epitope in both b2GPI and R. int DNMT. 
Moreover, APS patients had elevated levels of anti-R. int DNMT IgG compared to NHDs (Figure 4A). When comparing the mutant R. int DNMTD122-126 with wild-type R. int DNMT, anti-DNMT IgG levels in APS patients were decreased (Fig-
ure 4A). We did not observe a signifcant loss of binding in healthydonors(Figure 4A), suggesting that APS patients but not healthy subjects had antibodies specifc for the mimotope. Anti-R. int DNMT and anti-R.int DNMTD122-126 IgG levels remained consistent across time (Figures S7A and S7B). Furthermore, plasma anti-R. int DNMT IgG levels signifcantly correlated with anti-b2GPI IgG levels in APS patients but not in NHDs (Figures 4B and 4C). Providing additional support for epitope specifcity, signifcant correlation to anti-b2GPI IgG was lost when comparing anti-b2GPI IgG with anti-R. int DNMTD122-126 IgG levels (Figure S7C). These data reveal a robust correlation between anti-R. int DNMT IgG and anti-b2GPI IgG titers ex vivo, which is lost when the RGGMR mimic sequence is mutated in R. int DNMT. 
Immunization of BALB/c Mice with R. int Induces Human b2GPI Cross-Reactivity 
To determine if R. int is able to induce cross-reactivity in vivo, we immunized BALB/c mice as prior immunization studies in this strain were shown to induce T cell and antibody responses to both DI and DV b2GPI domains (Salem et al., 2015). As a control, we chose another prevalent human gut bacterium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta), which contained no DV mimotope and only a partial RGGMR epitope in a non-DNMT protein (Figure 5A). Lymphocytes from spleens or peripheral lymph nodes of R. int-immunized mice proliferated signifcantly more to recombinant human b2GPI (rhb2GPI) than 
B. theta-or sham-immunized mice (Figures 5B and 5C), support-ing peripheral cross-reactive lymphocyte responses in vivo. 
Next, we immunized BALB/c mice with R. int in incomplete Freund¡¯s adjuvant (IFA) only over a 48-day time course to allow for full development of a humeral response to the bacteria. Mice immunized with R. int lysates had markedly elevated titers of serum anti-rhb2GPI IgG autoantibodies compared to B. theta-or sham-immunized controls (Figure 5D). Supporting epitope-specifc cross-reactivity, we observed a signifcant decrease in binding to rhb2GPID39-43 (Figure 5D). Consistent with these fndings, anti-R. int DNMT IgG levels were markedly elevated in 
R. int-immunized mice compared to B. theta-or sham-immu-nized control mice (Figure 5E). Lastly, we observed a signifcant loss of binding to the RGGMR epitope-mutant recombinant R. int DNMTD122-126 (Figure 5E), which supports mimotope specifcity within the bacterial protein besides autoepitope specifcity within the autoantigen b2GPI. 
We noted that B. theta immunization induced a slight but sig-nifcant rise in anti-rhb2GPI and anti-R. int DNMT IgG titers compared to IFA alone, and reduced binding to rhb2GPID39-43 and R. int DNMTD122-126 (Figures 5D and 5E). This could be ex-plained by the presence of a partial RGGMR sequence (4 out of the 5 core amino acids) expressed by B. theta (Figure 5A). However, compared to R. int-immunized mice, B. theta binding to b2GPI and DNMT was signifcantly decreased, possibly owing

et al., 1992; Takemura et al., 1989). This model is characterized by an autoimmune gene duplication on the Y chromosome, rendering males susceptible to disease. This innate genetic pre-disposition is mirrored also functionally in human APS and thus represents a useful model to test adaptive immune stimuli from gut commensals (Giannakopoulos and Krilis, 2013). All mice were pre-treated with vancomycin for 2 weeks prior to gavage with R. int for several reasons. First, vancomycin has been shown by our lab to protect F1 male mice from developing auto-antibodies and APS by depleting a pathobiont identifed in this model (Figure S8)(Manfredo Vieira et al., 2018). Secondly, 
R. int is a human gut-adapted commensal that does not normally colonize a murine colon. After vancomycin pre-treatment to open the colonic niche for R. int, we repeatedly gavaged mice with fresh cultures of R. int or media alone and measured auto-antibodies at 16 weeks of age when anti-b2GPI IgG peaks (Fig-
ure 6A) (Manfredo Vieira et al., 2018). R. int-gavaged (n = 17) but not control-gavaged F1 male (n = 16) or R. int-gavaged female (n = 6) mice developed high-titer anti-b2GPI IgG autoan-tibodies as well as anti-R. int DNMT IgG antibodies (Figure 6A). Autoantibodies were markedly above low titers detectable in control-gavaged F1 males at 16 weeks of age that are likely induced by a recolonizing microbiota. Human anti-b2GPI IgG positively correlated with anti-R. int DNMT IgG, similarly to what we observed in APS patient plasma (Figures 6B and 4B). Importantly, R. int-gavaged F1 males showed extensive myocar-dial as well as subendocardial infammation with large lympho-cytic infltrates and necrosis, which were not seen in controls that survived beyond 30 weeks of age (Figures 6C, 6D, S9A, and S9B). Additionally, areas of hemorrhage were noted in one mouse, which can be associated with chronic ischemia from old myocardial infarction, a fnding seen in prior studies (Hashi-
moto et al., 1992; Takemura et al., 1989). Furthermore, R. int-gavaged¡ªbut not control¡ªanimals suffered from prominent lymphocytic infltrates in the lungs (Figures S9C and S9D). The histopathologic fndings developed at the time of premature deaths of R. int-gavaged mice, which occurred as early as 16 weeks of age (Figures 6C, S9A, and S9C). Overall, these re-sults support that colonization of a genetically prone host with a primary human isolate of mimotope-containing R. int is suff-cient to elicit cross-reactive, pathogenic T and B cell responses in vivo, leading to APS-related morbidity and mortality. 
DISCUSSION 
Antigens from the microbiota are continuously recognized by the adaptive immune system during homeostasis. This pro-cess generates a pool of memory T cells and IgG+ memory B cells that can potentially cross-react with antigens from

pathogens or self (Birnbaum et al., 2014; Blank et al., 2002; Greiling et al., 2018; Horai et al., 2015; Su et al., 2013; Szymula et al., 2014; Tai et al., 2016; Varrin-Doyer et al., 2012). The gut microbiota is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases by this mechanism (Dehner et al., 2019; Ruff and Kriegel, 2015), which is supported by recent murine studies cited above and an obvious case of ortholog cross-reactivity in humans (Greiling et al., 2018). Since the number of microbiota-derived proteins exceeds by 100-fold the number of eukaryotic proteins in the host, non-orthologous commensal cross-reactivity is likely to impact the development and maintenance of human autoimmune diseases via T and B cell cross-reactivity. 
We utilized the systemic autoimmune disorder APS as a para-digm. Infectious agents are the main factors associated with catastrophic APS, which still leads to exceedingly high mortality despite current treatment (Asherson et al., 2001; Cervera et al., 2015). Besides triggers leading to acute thrombotic events, addi-tional factors induce and sustain chronic autoimmunity in APS patients. We identifed the common human gut commensal 
R. int as a chronic driver of b2GPI autoreactivity based on non-orthologous mimotopes to major autoantigenic epitopes. APS

patients had signs of subclinical intestinal infammation together with peripheral adaptive immune recognition of R. int. The latter was refected by circulating anti-R. int antibodies polarized to the IgG isotype, indicating a mature, class-switched B cell response to R. int in APS patients compared to controls. APS CD4+ mem-ory T cells, specifc for the HLA-DRB4*0103-restricted b2GPI epitope p276-290, cross-reacted with a mimotope derived from R. int and had a Th1-like phenotype. Moreover, we demon-strated that an APS-derived monoclonal antibody with LA activ-ity exhibits pathogenic features by functionally impairing human trophoblasts. We were able to show that this functional mAb, which targets the pathogenic DI epitope R39-R43, bound to both R. int lysates as well as the mimotope within the R. int pro-tein DNMT. Ex vivo, APS patient plasma also bound to the mimotope within R. int DNMT, a fnding that positively correlated with anti-b2GPI IgG autoantibody titers. Finally, we also demon-strated T and B cell cross-reactivity in vivo with progression to full-blown clinical disease in a genetically susceptible back-ground. These fndings support a role for R. int-mediated cross-reactivity in the development and maintenance of patho-genic autoantibodies in genetically predisposed individuals. In non-predisposed individuals, commensal mimotopes likely provide a source of antigen-specifc tolerance in homeostatic settings. This hypothesis is partially supported by a recent study showing that commensal-specifc diabetogenic T cells are re-cruited to the gut and were capable of suppressing colitis (Heb-
bandi Nanjundappa et al., 2017). In a genetically predisposed host, this mechanism of tolerance may break down and support the induction and maintenance of pathogenic autoreactive lym-phocytes. Additional insults act then as a tipping point that allow for pathogenic cross-reactivity to progress to tissue damage and overt autoimmune pathology. These data are consistent with the current ¡®¡®second hit hypothesis¡¯¡¯ in APS, which states that additional environmental hits, such as oxidative stress or lipo-polysaccharide (LPS), lead to acute thrombotic events following systemic anti-b2GPI responses in vivo (Agar et al., 2011; Fischetti et al., 2005; Laplante et al., 2011). 

Following this model, exposed, cross-reactive epitopes on gut commensals, that naturally turn over in the gut and release immunogenic antigens such as DNMT, may induce autoanti-bodies against the unexposed, cryptic epitopes in b2GPI years before a second, innate immune-driven event occurs (¡®¡®second hit hypothesis¡¯¡¯). Such ¡®¡®second hits¡¯¡¯ then lead to exposure of the cryptic epitopes within b2GPI, which facilitates binding of pathogenic autoantibodies to b2GPI DI and subsequent throm-botic episodes. This scenario is plausible given the immense antigenic variability of the microbiota and the various second hits that can occur in humans such as oxidative events during stress or trauma, a burst of LPS in the circulation during gram-negative infections, exposure of phospholipids during excessive apoptosis or viral infections (Giannakopoulos and Krilis, 2013; Passam et al., 2011; Ruff et al., 2015). The gut microbiota likely contributes also to these second hits if one considers that phos-pholipids, LPS, or oxidative stress can also be derived from com-mensals. This is particularly likely in the setting of heightened gut infammation, as we noted in APS patients, or a disturbed gut barrier present in a spontaneous model for lupus-related APS (Manfredo Vieira et al., 2018). 
In summary, a complex interplay between antigen-specifc responses against chronically colonizing commensals in a hu-man host together with a genetic predisposition and intermittent ¡®¡®second hits¡¯¡¯ from the environment are likely drivers of persis-tent autoreactive T and B cells with subsequent waves of tissue damage. Defning the molecular interactions between the host immune system and the microbiota will be essential for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic immune dis-eases. This study dissected a molecular process of host-micro-biota interactions in the multistep pathogenesis of APS that may be applicable more broadly to other autoimmune diseases. In addition, similar processes may apply to microbiota effects on antitumor immunity, where a cross-reactive tissue-directed host response would be desirable (Routy et al., 2018). Evolu-tionarily, commensal cross-reactive immune responses may be tolerated by the host to allow for tumor surveillance and enhanced pathogen clearance under infammatory conditions. The trade-off would be a heightened risk of developing and sus-taining autoimmunity in susceptible individuals as we have demonstrated here.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS 
Human Subjects 

15 patients positive for anti-b2GPI IgG autoantibodies (11 APS patients and 4 individuals at risk for developing APS, ages 27-70, total 44 samples, see Table 1) and 20 normal healthy donors (NHD, ages 21¨C60, total 48 samples) were recruited from two institutions: Yale University, New Haven, CT, and Hospital for Special Surgery, New York, NY. Inclusion criteria were: Persistent positivity (defned as positive for b2GPI autoantibodies ¡À classifcation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), primary or associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, in accordance with the revised Sapporo criteria, with positive anti-b2GPI IgG defned as titers above 40 chemilumi-nescent units (Miyakis et al., 2006) and ages of 18-75. Exclusion criteria were as follows: ongoing chronic infection, antibiotic or probiotic use in the last 90 days, major gastrointestinal surgery in the last 5 years, gastrointestinal bleeding history, infammatory bowel disease, bulimia or anorexia nervosa, morbid obesity defned as body mass index (BMI) greater than 40, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, concurrent autoimmune disease with the exception of systemic lupus erythematosus, malignancy in the past year, current pregnancy, and known excessive alcohol use. Subjects with APS and healthy donors completed up to three monthly study visits for the collection of detailed health and diet histories, whole blood, serum, plasma, and fecal microbiota sampling. DNA was extracted from blood using DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). HLA typing was performed as previously published for HLA-DRB4*01 (serotype DR53) (Olerup and Zetterquist, 1992). Further study details are listed at ClinicalTrials.gov identifers NCT01787305 and NCT02394964. Metadata about participants, including gender, age, BMI, dietary and medical history, are described in Tables 1 and S1. A majority of our cohort were female. When samples sizes were suffcient for statistical power, we found no differences between APS males and females and NHD males and females. All human subject protocols were approved by the Yale Human Investigations Committee and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. A signed document of informed consent was obtained from all study subjects. 

Animals 
Specifc-pathogen-free BALB/cJ, NZW/LacJ, and BXSB/mpJ mice were purchased from Jackson laboratory and further housed and bred in the Yale Amistad Animal Facility under specifc-pathogen-free conditions. 10-to 12-week-old BALB/cJ male and female litter-mate mice were used for immunization studies. There were no signifcant differences between male and female BALB/cJ responses to immunizations. 4-6-week -old (NZW x BXSB)F1 male and female hybrids were used for oral gavage study and bred as previously described (Manfredo Vieira et al., 2018). Female (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice do not develop disease and were used as a negative control for the effect of R. intestinalis. Mice were provided with water and a standard laboratory diet ad libitum (2018 Harlan Teklad) except if noted otherwise. They were supplied with hardwood chips as bedding and housed in a temperature-controlled, air-conditioned room on a 12-hr light-dark cycle. Animal care and handling was approved by the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Facility and in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 
Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions, and Lysate Preparation 
Human stool isolates of Roseburia intestinalis L1-82 (R. int) and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 (B. theta) were grown in Gut Microbiota Medium (Goodman et al., 2011) anaerobically at 37Cto anOD600 value of 1.5-1.7 for all experiments. All cultures were confrmed to be pure by PCR amplifcation of the 16S rRNA region (forward primer AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG; reverse primer GACGGGCGGTGWGTRCA; 95C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 95C for 10 s, 60C for 20 s, 72C for 15 s; 72C for 10 min) (Turner et al., 1999), followed by Sanger sequencing. 
Bacterial lysates were prepared from pelleted monocultures of bacteria, washed three times with PBS, bead-beaten using 0.1-mm glass beads for 2 minutes, centrifuged at 10,000 g x 5 min, and quantifed by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) using a BSA standard curve (Thermo Fisher). 
METHOD DETAILS 
Identi.cation of Commensal Epitopes with Homology to b2GPI Autoepitopes 
Beta 2-glycoprotein I (b2GPI) epitope mimics were identifed by searching non-redundant protein database in NCBI BLAST for the major epitopes associated with b2GPI. The major B cell epitope, previously identifed as spanning residues R39-R43 (RGGMR), and 6-8 overlapping sequences from the human HLA-DRB4*01 (serotype DR53)-restricted immunodominant epitope p276-290 (KVSFFCKNKEKKCSY) were used as query sequences with searches limited to bacteria. Results were manually annotated to exclude known human pathogens and further cross-referenced with the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) and the Human Microbiome Project for previous identifcation as a human commensal (Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012a, 2012b; Wattam et al., 2017). Commensal protein sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011). The 
R. intestinalis DNA methyltransferase (WP_118597735.1) structural model was prepared by homology modeling with SWISS-MODEL (ExPASy) (Arnold et al., 2006; Biasini et al., 2014; Guex et al., 2009; Kiefer et al., 2009). 
Stool Sample Collection 
Stool samples were collected by subjects at home in sterile containers and shipped overnight on ice to the laboratory, at which time they were aliquoted and stored at -80C. Fecal DNA was extracted according to the HMP protocol (Aagaard et al., 2013). 80 to 200 mg of human stool was combined with 1 ml of Qiagen Bead Solution and 1-mm ceramic beads (BioSpec) and bead-beaten twice for 1 minute with a 2-minute rest on ice in between using a mini-beadbeater (Biospec). Samples were centrifuged and supernatant was transferred to a Qiagen Garnet Bead tube, heated for 10 minutes at 65C, then heated for 10 minutes at 95C, followed by further processing per the Qiagen DNeasy Power Soil DNA Isolation Kit protocol. 
16S rRNA Sequencing 
Dual-indexed 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was performed on isolated fecal DNA or IgA+ and IgA -sorted bacterial DNA as previously described (Kozich et al., 2013; Palm et al., 2014). The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplifed, pooled, normal-ized, and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform with 2 x 250 bp paired-end reads. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing reads was performed as previously described (Cullen et al., 2015). The following minor modifcations were included. QIIME analysis was performed using version 2 core distribution 2018.11.0, with denoising performed using DADA2 (trimLeft = 0 nucleotides for forward and reverse; truncLen = 251 nucleotides forward and 250 nucleotides reverse) (Callahan et al., 2016; Caporaso et al., 2010). Denoised and fltered amplicon sequencing variants were rarefed to a depth of 7091 sequences per sample for analysis of overall composition and 5528 sequences per sample for IgA-seq. 

Fecal Calprotectin and Plasma Lipocalin-2 Assays 

Calprotectin was measured in a single frozen stool sample from human subjects using the Legend MaxTM ELISA kit (BioLegend). Stool samples were aliquoted into pre-weighed bead-containing tubes and stored at -80C until sample preparation. 100 mg of stool samples were diluted with 1 ml Tris pH 7.4 followed by bead-beating for 5 s. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was carefully transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube avoiding the pellet. The supernatant was centrifuged again using the same settings as above. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube and diluted 1:20 with a dilution buffer supplied in the Legend MaxTM ELISA kit. Lipocalin-2 was measured in previously frozen human plasma from all subjects using the Legend MaxTM ELISA kit (BioLegend). Experimental samples were assayed with the standards and controls included with the kit according to the manufacturer¡¯s instructions. 
Plasma Anti-R. int Ig Bacterial Flow Cytometry and Sorting of Fecal IgA-Coated Bacteria 
1 ml of fresh R. int L1-82 cultures were pelleted (8,000 x g, 1 min, room temperature) and frozen prior to use. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, staining buffer) and washed twice with staining buffer. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of staining buffer and pooled. 100 ml-aliquots were incubated with 1 ml of plasma overnight at 4C. Samples were pelleted and washed twice with staining buffer. Samples were then pelleted and resuspended in blocking buffer (staining buffer containing 20% Normal Mouse Serum from MP Biomedical), incubated for 20 min on ice, and then stained with 100 ml staining buffer containing PE-conjugated anti-human IgA (1:20; Miltenyi Biotec clone IS11-8E10), FITC-conjugated anti-human IgM (1:20; Jackson ImmunoResearch polyclonal), and PerCP-conjugated anti-human IgG (1:20; Jackson ImmunoResearch polyclonal) for 30 min on ice. Samples were then washed twice with 1-ml staining buffer before fow cytometric analysis. 
Fecal samples were prepared as previously described (Palm et al., 2014). Briefy, approximately 100 mg of frozen human fecal material were placed in 2-ml microtubes (Sarstedt AG & Co.) containing 1-mm ceramic beads (Big D Lysing Matrix, MP Biomedicals) and incubated in 1-ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) per 100 mg fecal material on ice for 30 minutes. Fecal pellets were homog-enized by bead beating for 5 s (MiniBeadBeater-16, BioSpec products, Inc.) and then centrifuged (50 3 g, 15 min, 4C) to remove large particles. Fecal bacteria in the supernatants were removed (100 ml/sample), washed with 1 ml PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, staining buffer) and centrifuged for 5 min (8,000 3 g,4C) before resuspension in 1 ml staining buffer. After an additional wash, bacterial pellets were resuspended in 100 ml blocking buffer (staining buffer containing 20% Normal Mouse Serum from MP Biomedical), incubated for 20 min on ice, and then stained with 100 ml staining buffer containing PE-conjugated anti-human IgA (1:20; Miltenyi Biotec clone IS11-8E10) for 30 min on ice. Samples were then washed twice with 1-ml staining buffer before fow cytometric analysis or cell separation via FACS (FACS Aria, BD Biosciences). For each separated sample, 2 million IgA-positive bac-teria were collected, pelleted (10,000 3 g, 5 min, 4C), and frozen along with the IgA-negative samples at -80C for future use. IgA coating percentages were determined by dividing the total IgA+ bacteria by the total number of bacteria analyzed by FACS. IgA coating index (ICI) was determined as previously described (Palm et al., 2014). Heat map of ICI was generated with ¡®¡®heatmap.2¡¯¡¯ and ¡®¡®vegan¡¯¡¯ R packages. 
Gene Expression Analysis 

Quantitative real-time PCRs of genus, species, and total bacterial load as well as R. intestinalis genes containing autoepitope mimics, were performed on a QuantStudio 6 (Applied Biosystems). RNA was isolated from tissue sections and stored in Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientifc) at -80C. RNA was then quantifed and purifed with a DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientifc). cDNA was generated using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientifc). Relative load and expression were determined using 20 ng of stool or isolated bacterial DNA, 250 nM forward and reverse primers, and Power SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher) in a total reaction volume of 20 ml in either duplicates or triplicates. Samples were heated at 95C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 15 s, 55C for 1 min. 
Primer Pairs 

R. intestinalis species-specifc (CBL07561.1) forward CTTGTGACAGATGATGAAGATCGTG, reverse GCAGATCAGTCCTTTTCC ATGTGTT, length 114 nt, effciency 96.2%; universal 16S rRNA forward CGGCAACGAGCGCAACCC, reverse CCATTGTAGCA CGTGTGTAGC, length 146 nt, effciency 89% (Denman and McSweeney, 2006); R. intestinalis DNMT-specifc (WP_118597735.1) forward TGGACGAATCATCCGAACCC, reverse CCCTCGAACCTTTCAGTCCC, length 115 nt, effciency 99.1%; and R. intestinalis T cell mimic-specifc (EEU99424.1) forward AGAAAATCCGTCAAAGACTGGGA, reverse CGCCAAAGACCCACTGCATAG, length 52 nt, effciency 87%. 
All commensal-specifc and gene-specifc primers were validated by determining qPCR effciency using isolated bacterial DNA ranging from 20 ng to approximately 2.5 pg using 2-fold dilutions. Each primer pair had a single peak during melt curve analysis and a single band by gel electrophoresis. Specifcity was tested by using primers to amplify 20 ng of unrelated bacteria 
(B. theta, Eubacterium rectale, E. coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and fecal DNA previously shown to contain or not contain Roseburia at the genus level by 16S rRNA sequencing. Replicates were averaged and bacterial load was quantifed using the delta-delta-Ct method per the formula: 2 ^ -((Ct of experimental sample ¨C Ct of experimental sample 16S) ¨C (Ct of control bacteria ¨C Ct of control bacteria 16S)). If replicates were not concordant, i.e. one well failed to amplify, the assay was repeated with a new sample. 

Production and Puri.cation of Proteins and Antibodies 
Double-stranded DNA sequences corresponding to mature human b2GPI (apolipoprotein H, NP_000033.2) or mature human b2GPI with alanine replacing the R39-R43 (rhb2GPID39-43) were purchased as gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies). These sequences were cloned into a custom pcDNA3.4 expression vector (Thermo Fisher) containing an N-terminal human CD5 signal peptide, a C-terminal HRV3C protease cleavage site, and a C-terminal murine IgG2a. These proteins were expressed in EXPI293F mammalian expression system (Thermo Fisher) and purifed over a HiTrap protein A column (GE Healthcare). EXPI 293F cells were cultured as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefy, EXPI293F cells were thawed and incubated in EXPI 293 expression medium (Thermo Fisher) in 125-ml polycarbonate, disposable, sterile, vent-cap Erlenmeyer shaker fasks. EXPI293F cells were cultured at 37Cat 8% CO2 on an orbital shaker set to 125 rpm. Transfection was carried out per the manufacturer¡¯s instructions. Briefy, 7.5 x 107 viable cells in 25.5 ml of Expi293 Expression medium were transfected with 30 mg of purifed plasmid DNA. Purifed plasmid DNA was diluted in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM reduced serum medium. 81 ml of ExpiFectamine 293 reagent were diluted into 1.5ml of Opti-MEM reduced serum medium, gently mixed and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. After the 5-minute incubation the diluted plasmid DNA and ExpiFectamine 293 reagent were mixed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Following this 20-minute incubation step, the DNA-ExpiFectamine mix was added to 25.5 ml of EXPI293F cells and incubated as above. After 20 hours of culture, 150 ml of ExpiFectamine 293 transfection enhancer 1 and 1.5 ml of enhancer 2 were added to the cultures. Cultures supernatant was collected after 72 hours of further incubation and centrifuged at 800 x g for 5 minutes. Culture supernatant was further passed through a 0.2-mM flter before being purifed over a HiTrap protein A column (GE Healthcare). Following purifcation, the mIgG2a tag was cleaved by HRV3C protease overnight at 4C (Thermo Fisher). Cleaved protein was separated from mIgG2a by purifcation over a HiTrap protein A column. Cleaved, tagless recombinant proteins were validated to be devoid of contaminating mIgG2a by SDS-PAGE, western blot, and ELISA, respectively. Heavy and light chains of the previously identifed anti-human b2GPI clones P1-117 (HQ129860.1 and HQ129861.1) and P2-6 (HQ129864.1 and HQ129865.1) were obtained as gBlocks and cloned into a pcDNA 3.1 expression vector containing full length human IgG1. Antibodies were expressed and purifed as above. Purifed products were confrmed to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE and western blot. Serum-derived human b2GPI was purchased from Haematologic Technologies. Recombinant R. int DNMT and R. int DNMTD122-126 fused with C-terminal 6xHis-tag were pur-chased from GenScript technologies and shown to be >90% pure and <1.0 EU endotoxin. 
Trophoblast Migration and Trophoblast-Endothelial Cell Co-Cultures 
The human frst trimester extravillous trophoblast telomerase-transformed cell line Sw.71 was used for trophoblast experiments (Straszewski-Chavez et al., 2009). The trophoblast cell line was cultured in DMEM (Gibco-Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone), 10 mM Hepes, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids, 1mM sodium pyruvate and 100 nM penicillin/ streptomycin (Gibco-Invitrogen) and maintained at 37C, 5% CO2. Trophoblast cells were treated in serum-free OptiMEM (Gibco) with media alone, anti-b2GPI IgG1 mAb P1-117 (50 mg/ml), or an isotype control human IgG1 (Southern Biotech) (50 mg/ml). Tropho-blast migration was measured using a two-chamber colorimetric assay from EMD Millipore as described (Gysler et al., 2016; Mulla et al., 2010). Trophoblast viability was measured using the CellTiter 96 assay (Promega) as described (Mulla et al., 2009). A three-dimensional in vitro system was used to study trophoblast-endothelial cell interactions as a model for spiral artery transformation (Alvarez et al., 2015). Human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) (Krikun et al., 2004; Schatz et al., 2000) were cultured in fasks coated with 2% gelatin in Endothelial Basal Medium-2 (Lonza) supplemented with 2% FBS and maintained at 37C/5% CO2. HEECs were stained with the red fuorescent linker dye PKH-26 (Sigma) and seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates over undiluted reduced growth factor Matrigel (Corning). Cells were cultured overnight until tube-like structures were observed. Media was then removed and replaced with trophoblast Sw.71 cells stained with the green fuorescent linker dye PKH-67 (Sigma) in OptiMEM media alone, or with P1-117 (50 mg/ml) or control IgG (50 mg/ml). The trophoblast-endothelial co-culture was then incubated for 48 hrs. Over this time, the trophoblast cells are observed by fuorescent microscopy to invade the Matrigel, invade and co-localize with the endo-thelial cells, and eventually replace them to take on the vessel tube-like structures (Aldo et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2015). After 48 hrs, fve felds per well were recorded by fuorescent microscopy (Carl-Zeiss Observer Z1) using OpenLab software (Perkin Elmer) and the number of tubes per feld counted. 
Immunization Scheme with Bacterial Lysates for In Vivo Lymphocyte Proliferation 
10-to 12-week-old male and female BALB/c mice were immunized s.c. initially with 100 mgof R. intestinalis, B. theta, or no lysate (sham) in complete Freund¡¯s adjuvant (CFA). 14 days post-initial immunization, mice were immunized s.c. with 100 mg of lysate or sham in incomplete Freund¡¯s adjuvant (IFA). A fnal s.c. immunization was performed seven days later with 100 mg of lysate or sham per mouse in IFA. Mice were euthanized fve days after the third immunization. 
Immunization Scheme with Bacterial Lysates for In Vivo Serum Antibody Responses 
10-to 12-week-old male and female BALB/c mice were immunized s.c. with 100 mg of bacterial lysates or sham in IFA. Mice were immunized every 14 days as above for a total of four immunizations. Mice were euthanized fve days after the fnal immunization. 

Oral Gavage of (NZW x BXSB)F1 Mice with R. intestinalis 

4-6-week-old (NZW x BXSB)F1 hybrids were given orally vancomycin for two weeks as previously described (Manfredo Vieira et al., 2018). Mouse fecal pellets were collected after two weeks of vancomycin and confrmed to be devoid of Enterococcus gallinarum as previously described (Manfredo Vieira et al., 2018). After a 48-hour period without vancomycin, mice were orally gavaged with 100 ml containing 109 CFU of freshly cultured R. int L1-82, which was washed in culture media without short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) two times, or with culture media alone without SCFAs as control. Aliquots for gavage were prepared anaerobically. Gavages were performed weekly until 20 weeks of age. Blood and serum were collected at 16 weeks of age when autoantibodies peak in the (NZW x BXSB)F1 model (Manfredo Vieira et al., 2018). Mice were followed until APS-related deaths or 34 weeks of age. 
Histology 

Hearts and lungs of (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice were dissected at the time of euthanasia and fxed in 10% neutral formalin. After paraffn embedding, sectioning, and staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), histologic features of each sample were assessed in a blinded fashion using an Olympus microscope (Olympus DP71). Representative pictures were taken and analyzed using the cellSens software (Olympus). 
Lymph Node and Spleen Proliferation Assays 

Peripheral lymph nodes (inguinal and axillary) and spleens from BALB/c mice were harvested in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technol-ogies) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 2 mM Hepes, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50 U/ml, Lonza), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Tissues were dissociated into single cell suspensions and fltered through a 40-mm cell strainer and washed into RPMI. For spleens, red blood cells were lysed with 1 ml of red blood cell lysing buffer (Sigma) for 1 minute, then washed three times with PBS. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 25,000 cells per well, then stim-ulated with rhb2GPI (50 mg/ml) and incubated for 72 hours at 37C. After that, cells were transferred to white opaque 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-one 655073). Proliferation was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminscent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) or ATPlite 1step luminescence kit (Perkin Elmer) following the manufacturers¡¯ instructions. 
Immunoassays 

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for b2GPI, R. intestinalis DNMT, and bacterial lysate were performed with 96-well high-binding, hydrophobic, positively charged plates (Corning 3369) coated with 5 mg/ml for recombinant serum-derived or recombinant b2GPI, or 25 mg/ml of the soluble fraction of bacterial lysates in NaHPO4 (pH 7.6) overnight at 4C, washed three times with PBS with 0.01% Tween-20, blocked with protein-free blocking buffer (Pierce 37572) for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking, and incu-bated with primary antibody diluted in protein-free blocking buffer at room temperature with shaking for 2 hours. Wells were washed 4 times and incubated with pre-adsorbed horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody sheep anti-human IgG 1:6,000 (Thermo Fisher 31412) or rabbit anti-mouse IgG 1:1,000 (Thermo Fisher A16166) diluted in protein-free blocking buffer for 30 minutes, followed by fve washes and colorimetric development with TMB Substrate Buffer (Thermo Fisher). Reactions were stopped after 15 minutes with 2M H2SO4. Previously frozen plasma samples were used to determine the presence of anti-domain I b2GPI IgG by chemiluminescent immunoassay (CIA) (Inova Diagnostics). The anti-domain I b2GPI IgG CIA assay was performed by the manufacturer. 
Human T Cell Cloning and Proliferation Assays 

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood by Lymphoprep (STEMCELL Technologies) gradient centrifugation 24-hour post-blood draw. PBMCs were immunomagnetically separated using the following kits (STEMCELL Technol-ogies) per the manufacturers¡¯ instructions: monocytes using the EasySep Human CD14 Positive Selection kit, and CD4+ T cells using the EasySep Human CD4+ T Cell Negative Isolation kit. Total PBMCs and selected cells were frozen at -80C in 90% heat-inactivated human AB serum with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and transferred to liquid nitrogen within 24 hours. Human autologous monocytes were used as antigen-presenting cells for all T cell library assays. Cell numbers were assessed using the Neubauer counting chamber. 
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) Proliferation 

PBMCs were thawed and plated in 96-well round bottom plates (Corning) at a concentration of 25,000 cells per well in X-Vivo 15 media (Lonza). PMBCs were incubated with the soluble fraction of mechanically lysed, heat-killed R. int L1-82 lysates at a concentration of 1 mg/ml with or without treatment of Proteinase K at 50 mg/ml (Promega) followed by heat inactivation. PBMCs were cultured for 5 days and proliferation was measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation 16 hours before harvest. Stimulation index was calculated as proliferation of stimulated PBMCs divided by proliferation of unstimulated PBMCs. 
T Cell Library and Tetramer Assay 

Viable CCR6 memory (VVD-, CD45RA , CD45RO+, CD25 , CCR6) CD4+ T cells and CCR6+ memory (CD45RA , CD45RO+, CD25 , CCR6+) CD4+ T cells were sorted (antibodies from BioLegend) on a FACS Aria machine (BD Biosciences). CD25+ cells were excluded from sorting and analysis. Tetramer assays were performed by sorting into CD45RA , CD45RO+, CD25 , CCR6¡À, tetramer¡À populations. 

The T cell library assays were performed as previously described (Geiger et al., 2009). CCR6 and CCR6+ memory CD4+ T cells from APS patients were sorted and cultured in 96-well round-bottom plates (Corning) at 2,000 cells per well in X-Vivo 15 media (Lonza) or as single-cell clones in complete media (RPMI 1640 with 1% hepes, 1% glutamine, 1% pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% pen/strep, and 5% heat-inactivated human serum). Cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 1 mg/ml) (Roche) and rhIL-2 (30 U/ml) (R&D) in the presence of irradiated (45 Gy) allogeneic PBMCs (25,000 per well). IL-2 was added on days 3, 6, and 10, respectively. After 14 days of maintenance and expansion, T cell cultures were washed and split equally into two ¡®¡®mirror¡¯¡¯ 96-well plates. Library screening was carried out by stimulation of 250,000 T cells per well with irradiated (45 Gy) autologous monocytes (25,000 per well). Monocytes were then pulsed for 3 hours with 100 mg/ml native b2GPI. Wells responding to b2GPI were expanded and restimulated with irradiated monocytes pulsed with DV peptide (KVSFFCKNKEKKCSY) or commensal mimotope peptide (DV mimotope, RIFLFCRNKENVYHF). Negative controls contained unpulsed monocytes only. After 72 hours, culture supernatants were removed for cytokine measurement. Cell proliferation was measured either by measuring [3H]-thymidine incorporation on a scintillation b-counter (Perkin Elmer) or via non-radioactive ATP using the ATP lite kit (Perkin Elmer). 
Tetramer cell assays were performed using a similar approach: Tetramer-positive T cells were expanded as above, plated at 50,000 cells/well, and re-stimulated with 10,000 autologous monocytes per well pulsed with native b2GPI (100 mg/ml) or 100 mg/ml DV tetramer peptide (KVSFFCKNKEKKASY) as controls as well as whole heat-killed R. intestinalis (10 bacterial cells/1 monocyte). Proliferation was measured as described above. Supernatants were stored at -80C prior to cytokine analysis. 
Cytokine Immunoassays 
Cytokine concentrations from supernatants of memory CD4+ T cell clones were measured using a bead-based immunoassay for hu-man Tfh, Th1, and Th17 cytokines with custom LEGENDplex (BioLegend) and Luminex (Millipore) panels, respectively. Supernatants of activated T cell clones stimulated as detailed above were collected and LEGENDplex or Luminex panels were run according to the manufacturers¡¯ protocols. 
Bio-Layer Interferometry and Label-free Determination of KD Calculations 
Label-free kinetic assays were determined by bio-layer interferometry on a BLItz instrument (ForteBio). Manufacturer¡¯s instructions were followed unless otherwise noted. Sensors were soaked in and reagents diluted in kinetics buffer (ForteBio). Measurements consisted of 5 steps: Initial baseline 30 s, loading 180 s, baseline 120 s, association 300 s, dissociation 300 s. Purifed anti-b2GPI mAb P1-117 was immobilized onto anti-human IgG Fc capture biosensors at a concentration of 10 mg/ml (ForteBio). Sensorgrams were ft globally to a 1:1 binding model by BLItz Pro v1.1.0.28. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) and association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants were calculated from a minimum of 4 molar concentrations ranging from 200 nM to 25 nM with a 0 nM control. 
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Plotting of data and statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 7 software. Unless otherwise stated, statistical sig-nifcance was determined by the unpaired two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, and differences were considered statistically signifcant if the p-value was < 0.05. P-values are represented using * for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, *** for p < 0.001, and **** for p < 0.0001. Sample sizes and relevant statistical information can be found in corresponding fgure legends. Data are shown as means ¡À SEM unless otherwise noted. Shannon-Weiner diversity index was determined using the ¡®¡®vegan¡¯¡¯ R package (Oksanen et al., 2017; R Core Team, 2017). Weighted UniFrac distances were calculated in QIIME 2, core distribution 2018.11.0, using the Silva 132 reference data-base (Quast et al., 2013) and visualized using Emperor (Caporaso et al., 2010; Lozupone and Knight, 2005; Va¡ä zquez-Baeza et al., 2013).
