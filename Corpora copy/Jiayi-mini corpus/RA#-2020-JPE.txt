We consider several economic uncertainty indicators for the US and UK before and during the COVID-19 pan-
demic: implied stock market volatility, newspaper-based policy uncertainty, Twitter chatter about economic un-
certainty, subjective uncertainty about business growth, forecaster disagreement about future GDP growth, and a

model-based measure of macro uncertainty. Four results emerge. First, all indicators show huge uncertainty
jumps in reaction to the pandemic and its economic fallout. Indeed, most indicators reach their highest values
on record. Second, peak amplitudes differ greatly – from a 35% rise for the model-based measure of US economic
uncertainty (relative to January 2020) to a 20-fold rise in forecaster disagreement about UK growth. Third, time
paths also differ: Implied volatility rose rapidly from late February, peaked in mid-March, and fell back by late
March as stock prices began to recover. In contrast, broader measures of uncertainty peaked later and then

plateaued, as job losses mounted, highlighting differences between Wall Street and Main Street uncertainty mea-
sures. Fourth, in Cholesky-identified VAR models fit to monthly U.S. data, a COVID-size uncertainty shock fore-
shadows peak drops in industrial production of 12–19%.

1. Introduction

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell aptly summarized the level of uncer-
tainty in his May 21st speech, noting “We are now experiencing a whole

new level of uncertainty, as questions only the virus can answer complicate

the outlook.” Indeed, there is massive uncertainty about almost every as-
pect of the COVID-19 crisis, including the infectiousness and lethality of

the virus; the time needed to develop and deploy vaccines; whether a sec-
ond wave of the pandemic will emerge; the duration and effectiveness of

social distancing; the near-term economic impact of the pandemic and

policy responses; the speed of economic recovery as the pandemic re-
cedes; whether “temporary” government interventions will become per-
manent; the extent to which pandemic-induced shifts in consumer

spending patterns, business travel, and working from home will persist;
and the impact on business formation and research and development.1

In this light, we examine several measures of economic uncertainty before
and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus is on uncertainty measures
available in near real-time or with modest delays. We adopt this focus for
three reasons. First, many macro indicators become available with lags of
months or quarters, which limits their usefulness in producing real-time
uncertainty measures. Second, uncertainty measures have different
strengths and weaknesses. For example, measures derived from models

fit to standard macro data have the upside of being linked to a well-
defined concept of uncertainty, but the downside of being based on the

premise that past statistical relationships and their interpretation continue
to hold in the wake of sudden, novel developments. In reverse, newspaper

measures of uncertainty do not correspond to a precise model, but are for-
ward looking and available on a real-time basis. Third, when a large, novel

shock hits with great suddenness, it is especially vital for real-time fore-
casting purposes and for policy formulation to work with measures that

capture the uncertainties that economic agents actually perceive. Many
of the forward-looking uncertainty measures we consider can potentially
meet that test in a way that other measures cannot.
2. The extraordinary economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic

To appreciate the tremendous speed with which the COVID-19 eco-
nomic crisis unfolded and the magnitude of the shock, consider some

observations for the United States. New claims for unemployment ben-
efits in the early part of 2020 ranged from 200,000–280,000 per week.

Relative to covered employment, these figures correspond to the
slowest pace of new claims in the history of the series back to 1971.
Over the ensuing twelve weeks 40 million Americans filed new claims,
an astonishing surge without precedent in US history.2 As measured in

the Current Population Survey, unemployment rose from 3.5% in Febru-
ary 2020 – its lowest rate in over 60 years – to 14.7% in April, the highest

rate in 80 years.3 US GDP fell 11.2% from 2019Q4 to 2020Q2, the largest

drop since the Great Depression. A similar story of sharply contracting
output emerged in the UK, with GDP falling a record 20.4% in April–
June after a fall of 2.2% in January–March. In sum, the speed and scale

of the COVID-19 contraction dwarfs that of any previous US or UK epi-
sode in the modern era.

Another set of observations further underscores the lack of close his-
toric parallels to the economic impact of COVID-19. Barro et al. (2020)

estimate that the Spanish Flu pandemic a century ago killed about 40
million people worldwide, or about 2.1% of the world's population.
Worldwide deaths attributed to COVID-19 as of 18 August 2020 are
about 766,000 on a global population base of 7.7 billon, yielding a global
mortality rate of about 0.01%.4 Although the ultimate death toll will
surely be substantially higher, the size of the COVID-19 mortality
shock is likely to remain at least an order of magnitude smaller than
the one associated with the Spanish Flu. Seen in this light, the economic
toll of COVID-19 is anomalous.
In terms of mortality, the COVID-19 pandemic is much closer to

more recent influenza pandemics. The US Center for Disease Control es-
timates that the 1957–58 and 1968 influenza pandemics caused

116,000 and 100,000 excess deaths in the United States.5 Scaling by
population yields excess mortality rates of 0.067% in 1957–58 and
0.050% in 1968. As of 10 July 2020, US excess mortality during the
COVID-19 pandemic is (175,700/326.69 million) = 0.054%.6 It was an
estimated 0.52% during the Spanish Flu (Barro et al., 2020, Table 1).
Thus, the COVID-19 impact on excess mortality in the US is similar to

that of influenza pandemics in 1957–58 and 1968 and an order of mag-
nitude smaller than that of the Spanish Flu. Yet, as Ferguson, 2020un-
derscores, the 1957–58 pandemic imparted a mild impact on

2 The unemployment claims data are available at https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/

claims_arch.asp.The figures cited in the text are seasonally adjusted. 3 As noted in the April 2020 BLS Employment Situation Report, an unusually large num-
ber of persons classified as “employed but absent from work” during the reference week

(April 12–18) for the household survey. As discussed in the FAQs at https://www.bls.
gov/cps/employment-situation-covid19-faq-april-2020.pdf, it appears that many of the
“employed but absent from work” were, in fact, on temporary layoff. Adding these to
the 14.7% official unemployment rate for April 2020 yields and unemployment rate of
19.5% according to the BLS.

4633-b89c-cbdf5b386938, accessed 18 August 2020. Epidemiologists typically prefer ex-
cess mortality data, because they are more encompassing and less susceptible to

underreporting. However, they are available for fewer countries. We use excess mortality
data when discussing outcomes in the United Kingdom and the United States.

gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html. Glezen (1996) reports similar esti-
mates for excess mortality in the 1957–58 and 1968 pandemics and discusses the concept

of excess mortality.

index values constructed from the daily data as described in Baker et al. (2016). Subjective sales growth uncertainty is the activity-weighted average of the standard deviation of each firm's

aggregate economic activity. Similarly, US employment and output
grew at a healthy pace in 1968, showing no visible effect of the influenza
pandemic. These influenza pandemics offer a startling contrast to the
enormous economic contraction triggered by COVID-19.7
To summarize, the economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic is

unprecedented in at least two respects: First, the suddenness and enor-
mity of the economic shock, most visibly in massive job losses and, sec-
ond, the severity of the economic contraction relative to the size of the

mortality shock. There is no close historic parallel to the COVID-19 con-
traction, which underscores the need for forward-looking measures of

uncertainty. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 economic crisis
also provides some insight into why uncertainty has skyrocketed in its
wake.
3. Uncertainty measures
We now consider several uncertainty measures, with a focus on
forward-looking measures.
3.1. Stock market volatility
Examples include the 1-month and 24-month VIX, which quantify
the option-implied volatility of returns on the S&P 500 index over

their respective horizons. The 1-month VIX rose from about 15 in Janu-
ary 2020 to a peak daily value of 82.7 on 16 March before falling below

30 by early May. The second-highest daily value in the history of the 1-
month VIX, which dates back to 1990, was 80.9 on 27 October 2008.
Fig. 1 plots the evolution of weekly-average values for the 1-month
and 24-month VIX. The two series behave similarly in 2020, although
the amplitude of the peak upward fluctuation is considerably smaller
for the 24-month VIX. To push further back in time, one can calculate

the realized volatility of daily market returns using short look-back win-
dows that quickly capture abrupt changes in economic circumstances.

Baker et al. (2020a) take this approach. They find five great realized

return volatility episodes. Ordered by peak volatility, they are October
1987, the stock market crash of 1929, the coronavirus pandemic in
March 2020, March 1933 near the trough of the Great Depression, and
December 2008 during the Global Financial Crisis.
3.2. Newspaper-based uncertainty measures
Examples include the Economic Policy Uncertainty Indices of Baker
et al. (2016).
8 The daily version of this index reflects the frequency of
newspaper articles with one or more terms about “economics,” “policy”
and “uncertainty” in roughly 2000 US newspapers. It is normalized to

100 from 1985 to 2010, so values above 100 reflect higher-than-
average uncertainty. Fig. 2 plots weekly averages of the daily EPU,

which surges from around 100 in January 2020 to over 500 in March
and April 2020, reaching its the highest values on record. The monthly

US EPU index based on a balanced panel of major US newspapers dis-
plays a similar pattern and also reaches its highest values on record in

March, April and May 2020.9
Newspaper-based measures of uncertainty are forward looking in
that they reflect the real-time uncertainty perceived and expressed by
journalists. They stretch back to 1900 for the United States and are
now available for dozens of countries at www.policyuncertainty.com.
They also offer a ready ability to drill down into the sources of economic

uncertainty and its movements over time, as contemporaneously per-
ceived. For example, over 90% of newspaper articles about economic

policy uncertainty in March 2020 mention “COVID,” “Coronavirus,”
“pandemic” or other term related to infectious diseases.

Baker et al. (2019) develop a newspaper-based Equity Market Vola-
tility (EMV) tracker that closely mirrors movements in the VIX. Their

index lends itself to a quantitative exploration of news developments

that drive stock market volatility, again as contemporaneously per-
ceived by journalists. Applying their approach to infectious diseases,

they find that COVID-19 is the dominant topic in newspaper articles

7 The main text focuses on the US experience, but COVID-19 mortality rates differ
greatly among advanced countries. In the United Kingdom, one of the worst-hit countries,

excess mortality during the COVID-18 pandemic (as of 23 July 2020) is 0.096% of the pop-
ulation, about ten times greater than in Germany.

about stock market volatility since the last week in February. In compar-
ison, Ebola, SARS, H1N1 and other infectious disease outbreaks since

1985 made only minor contributions to stock market volatility.
3.3. Twitter-based economic uncertainty
To construct a Twitter-based economic uncertainty index (TEU), we

scrape all tweets worldwide that contain both “economic” and “uncer-
tainty” (including variants of each) from January 2010.10 We then com-
pute weekly EU tweet frequency, which we plot in Fig. 2 alongside the

weekly newspaper-based EPU index. The two series behave similarly
around the COVID-19 crisis.
3.4. Subjective uncertainty measures computed from business expectation
surveys

Examples include the US monthly panel Survey of Business Uncer-
tainty (SBU) and the UK monthly Decision Maker Panel (DMP).11

These panel surveys recruit participants by phone from databases that
cover nearly all public and private companies with employees (about

7 million in the US and about 1 million in the UK, although we only re-
cruit firms with a minimum size of 10 employees, which vastly reduces

the number of firms available to survey). The SBU has around 400 re-
spondents per month, and the DMP has around 3000. Core survey ques-
tions elicit five-point probability distributions (mass points and

associated probabilities) over each firm's own future sales growth

rates at a one-year look-ahead horizon. By calculating each firm's sub-
jective standard deviation about its own future growth rate forecast in

a given month, and aggregating over firms in that month, we obtain
an aggregate measure of subjective uncertainty about future sales
growth rates.
Fig. 3 plots these survey-based time-series measures of sales growth
rate uncertainty for the United States and the United Kingdom. These
measures show pronounced increases in uncertainty in March and
April 2020, before falling back slightly in May. But all three months are

well above any previous peaks in their (short) histories. See Altig et al.
(2020b) for evidence that firm-level growth expectations in the SBU

are highly predictive of realized growth rates, and that firm-level sub-
jective uncertainty predicts the magnitudes of future forecast errors

and future forecast revisions.
Fig. 4 draws on data from the UK Decision Maker Panel to depict how
COVID-induced uncertainty rose rapidly in March 2020. Specifically, we
exploit the large DMP sample to split the survey response periods and
subdivide the monthly data. The percentage of firms reporting that
COVID is “their single largest source of uncertainty” rose from about
25% at the beginning of March to almost 90% by early April, and then

slowly fell back to about 50% by late July. So, COVID became the over-
whelmingly dominant source of uncertainty for UK firms within a pe-
riod of less than four weeks. This is particularly striking given the

ongoing Brexit process in the UK, which is itself a major source of uncer-
tainty for firms Bloom et al., 2019. This pattern of a rapid spike in pan-
demic uncertainty in March in the UK aligns well with the US-
oriented evidence in Section 2 that the COVID-19 crisis unfolded with

extraordinary speed.
These business expectation surveys are valuable for measuring what
firms actually perceive in real time. They yield actionable data within 5
to 20 days of when the survey first goes to field. Their main downside is
the substantial cost of building the sample and fielding the survey each
month, and the need to accumulate data for comparisons over time.
Once in place, however, these surveys are highly flexible and allow for
rapid deployment of special questions that target current developments

and policy issues. They also allow analysis of uncertainty by region, in-
dustry, firm size and age, and growth rates. As an illustration,

data broken down by firm size and broad sector.

forecasters about one-year-ahead GDP growth rate forecasts. The

while the UK data are from the Survey of External Forecasters
(SEF). There is a long history of using such disagreement measures
to proxy for uncertainty, and also a long history of disagreement
about their suitability for that purpose. Our view is that at least
for real variables like GDP growth, high levels of disagreement
are reasonable proxies for high levels of economic uncertainty. To
quantify disagreement, we calculate the standard deviation of

GDP growth rate forecasts across forecasters. There are, on aver-
age, 41 forecasters per survey response period in the US and 23

in the UK.

As seen in Fig. 5, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered historically high
levels of disagreement in the growth rate forecasts. US disagreement
rose from a standard deviation 0.32 percentage points in 2020Q1 to
2.74 in 2020Q2, a rise of nearly 8-fold. UK forecast disagreement rose
from 0.49 percentage points to 10.1, an astounding 20-fold increase.

incorporates more than a hundred macroeconomic, sectoral and finan-
cial indicators.13 They adopt an iterative process to estimate innovations

in these indicators and use them to construct an overall, or macro, indi-
cator of the future variance (uncertainty) of these innovations. The JLN

Macro Uncertainty measure reaches an all-time high in March 2020, ris-
ing by 35% over its pre-pandemic January 2020 value. This pandemic

peak slightly eclipses its previous peak in 2008.
4. Comparing the uncertainty measures

Armed with these uncertainty measures, we turn now to three ques-
tions: How much did uncertainty rise in the wake of the COVID

13 These include real output and income, employment and hours, real retail, manufactur-
ing and trade sales, consumer spending, housing starts, inventories and inventory sales ra-
tios, orders and unfilled orders, compensation and labor costs, capacity utilization

measures, price indexes, bond and stock market indexes, and foreign exchange measures.

pandemic? When did it peak? How much, if it all, has it fallen since the
peak?
Table 1 summarizes our answers: First, every uncertainty measure
we consider rose sharply in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Most measures reached all-time peaks. The exceptions are the 24-
month VIX, which peaked during the Global Financial Crisis, and the
US GDP forecast disagreement measure, which peaked in the 1970s.
Second, there is huge variation in the magnitude of the increase.

Subjective uncertainty over sales growth rates at a one-year forecast ho-
rizon roughly doubles, as does the 24-month VIX. In contrast, disagree-
ment among professional forecasters about real GDP growth over the

next year rises roughly 8-fold for the United States and 20-fold for the
United Kingdom. The much greater rise in forecaster-based measures

of macro uncertainty, as compared to the rise in average firm-level un-
certainty, reflects the nature of the COVID-19 shock. It is a huge com-
mon shock that hit all firms. Normally, even in recessions, common

shocks are modest in size, and firm-level uncertainty is mainly driven
by idiosyncratic shocks that are largely diversified away at the aggregate
level. Thus, the pre-pandemic level of background risk is much greater
at the firm level than at the aggregate level.14 Against this backdrop, a
big jump in a common source of uncertainty triggers a larger percentage
increase in macro uncertainty.
The 1-month VIX, the newspaper-based EPU index, and the Twitter
EU index also show large upward spikes (in percentage terms) in the
wake of the COVID-19 shock. The 1-month VIX focuses on the near
term by construction, and the text-based measures are also likely to
give more attention to near-term sources of uncertainty rather than
distant-future uncertainty. In addition, the text-based measures reflect
a mix of macro and micro uncertainty, probably with a larger weight
on the former.
Third, the time profiles of uncertainty responses to the COVID-19
shock differ across the various measures. Fig. 7 offers a close-up look
at the recent behavior of several uncertainty measures that we can
track at sub-monthly intervals. It includes a Likert-based measure for

the UK derived from responses to the following DMP question: “How
would you rate the overall level of uncertainty facing your business at
the moment?” Response options are “Very high – very hard to forecast
future sales,” “High – hard to forecast future sales,” “Medium – future

sales can be approximately forecasted,” “Low – future sales can be accu-
rately forecasted,” and “Very low – future sales can be very accurately

forecasted.” For this measure, we display the percentage of firms that
report high or very high uncertainty.

Fig. 7 shows that the stock market volatility measures peak in mid-
March and then fall back to close to their pre-COVID levels by August.

In contrast, the real-side uncertainty measures peak later – or continue

to remain extremely high through late June in the case of subjective un-
certainty and through late July for economic policy uncertainty.15 This

contrast highlights the Wall Street/Main Street distinction that is also
apparent in first-moment outcomes. The S&P 500 index bottomed out
on 23 March 2020, having dropped 34% from its level on 19 February.
Since then, the market has risen sharply, recovering three-quarters of

its losses by the end of May and all of its losses and reaching new all-
time highs by mid-August.

5. Vector autoregressive models of the impact of uncertainty

We now fit vector autoregressive models (VARs) to estimate the re-
lationship of output and employment to uncertainty in US data. Draw-
ing causal inferences from VARs is challenging – in part because

policy, and policy uncertainty, can respond to current and anticipated
future economic conditions. Despite the challenges, VARs are useful
for characterizing dynamic relationships. At a minimum, they let us

gauge whether uncertainty innovations foreshadow weaker macroeco-
nomic performance conditional on standard macro and policy variables.

Given the rapid shifts in economic activity as the COVID-19 pan-
demic unfolded, we estimate our VAR systems on monthly data and

use industrial production as our output measure (since GDP data are
quarterly). We consider, in turn, four alternative uncertainty measures
for which long time series are available. We adopt a Cholesky

14 The smaller percentage rise in subjective uncertainty about firm-level growth rates in
the United Kingdom, as compared to the United States, also makes sense. U.K. firms were
already contending with Brexit-related uncertainty before the pandemic struck.

using information about firms' sales expectations and uncertainty for the first five weeks. VIX-24 M, Likert Uncertainty, and Sales Subjective Uncertainty's axes are hidden.

15 This pattern is broadly consistent with the Covid-related risk measure extracted from
quarterly earnings conference calls in Hassan et al. (2020)

decomposition with the following ordering: an uncertainty measure,
the log of the S&P 500 index, the federal funds rate, log manufacturing
employment, and log industrial production. This specification follows
Baker et al. (2016). Our baseline VAR specification includes three lags
of all variables. See the Appendix for additional details about the VAR
specification and our sources of data.
Fig. 8 displays (in red) the model-implied responses of industrial
production to a COVID-size uncertainty innovation, which we equate
to the uncertainty rise from January 2020 to its COVID-19 peak. For
comparison we include (in blue) the model-implied responses to a
2008/09-size increase in uncertainty, which we equate to the difference
between the January 2020 value and the peak uncertainty value in
2008/09. As seen in the upper right panel, a COVID-size innovation in
the model-based uncertainty measure of JLN foreshadows an estimated

12% fall in industrial production. This response magnitude is very simi-
lar to the drop implied by a 2008/09-size uncertainty shock, because the

two episodes involve very similar increases in this uncertainty measure.

In the lower left panel, a COVID-size innovation in the forecaster dis-
agreement measure of uncertainty foreshadows an estimated 19% fall

in industrial production. This response magnitude is about four times
as large as the drop implied by a 2008/09-size uncertainty shock
based on forecaster disagreement. Using the VIX as the uncertainty

measure yields results similar to those of the JLN measure. Using eco-
nomic policy uncertainty yields results more similar to the disagree-
ment measure, but with an earlier peak response and a faster bounce

back.

All of these VAR specifications predict a very sharp, but rather short-
lived reduction in industrial production in reaction to the COVID

uncertainty shock. The speed, size and rapid bounce back of industrial

production predicted by the VARs is broadly in line with actual experi-
ence. US industrial production fell 17% between February and April

2020 and then recovered half its losses by July. This dynamic response
path is most similar to the one shown for economic policy uncertainty
in the lower right panel of Fig. 8.

The appendix contains three additional sets of VAR results. First, em-
ployment responses to uncertainty shocks are similar to those for indus-
trial production, but somewhat smaller (Figure A3). Second, when we

fit the VAR models to a sample that ends in December 2019, we obtain
smaller peak response magnitudes for industrial production, except for

the VIX measure (Figure A4). Ending the sample in 2019 has little im-
pact on the shape of the impulse response functions. Third, when we re-
verse the ordering in the VAR systems, placing the uncertainty measure

last in the Cholesky ordering, we find very similar results to the ones
displayed in Fig. 8 (Figure A5).
6. Concluding remarks
We have examined a variety of economic uncertainty measures.
Four results emerge. First, all measures show huge uncertainty jumps

in reaction to the pandemic and its economic fallout. Indeed, most indi-
cators reach their highest values on record. Second, peak amplitudes dif-
fer greatly. For example, two-year implied volatility on the S&P 500

stock market index and subjective uncertainty about UK sales growth
rates rose by around 100% (relative to January 2020), while forecaster
disagreement about UK GDP growth rates rose 20-fold. Third, time
paths also differ: Implied stock market volatility rose rapidly from late

from January 2020 to their 2020 peaks (red lines), with 90% confidence bands, or to their 2008/09 peak (blue lines). We detrend following Hamilton (with p = 36, h = 12) and include
three lags of each variable. We identify innovations using a Cholesky ordering as follows: uncertainty, log(S&P 500 index), effective federal reserve funds rate, log(manufacturing
employment), and log(industrial production). We fit models to monthly data from October 1966 to June 2020 (VIX), October 1966 to April 2020 (macro uncertainty), August 1974 to
May 2020 (forecaster disagreement), and April 1989 to June 2020 (economic policy uncertainty).

February, peaked in mid-March, and fell back by late March as stock
prices partly recovered. In contrast, broader measures peaked later, as

job losses continued to mount. Broader measures plateaued or contin-
ued rising after March. Fourth, in Cholesky-identified VAR models fit

to monthly U.S. data, we find that a COVID-size uncertainty shock fore-
shadows peak drops in US industrial production of 12–19%, depending

on the uncertainty measures used. All VAR specifications we consider
imply abrupt, short-lived contractions in industrial production and a
rapid bounce back, in line with US experience through July 2020.
We also marshalled evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic and its
economic fallout lack close historic parallels in at least two respects:

First, the suddenness and enormity of the massive job losses and, sec-
ond, the severity of the economic contraction relative to the size of the

mortality shock. The unprecedented scale and nature of the COVID-19
crisis helps explain why it has generated such an extraordinary surge
in economic uncertainty.
It remains to be seen which uncertainty measures will prove most
useful in explaining economic developments during and after the
COVID-19 pandemic. Our prior is that several, and perhaps all, of these
measures will prove useful, because they capture different aspects of

economic uncertainty. For example, the subjective uncertainty mea-
sures are particularly apt for theories that stress the role of firm-level

risks in economic fluctuations (e.g., Christiano et al., 2014). The VIX

measures are obviously more apt for theories that link asset-pricing be-
havior to economic fluctuations. The EPU measures are highly relevant

for theories that link asset-pricing to political decision-making in reac-
tion to macroeconomic developments (e.g., Pastor and Veronesi,

2012). The newspaper-based and Twitter-based measures are perhaps
more closely aligned with the perceptions of households and salience
of news. All of the uncertainty measures we consider are potentially

useful in testing and implementing theories about investment and con-
sumption under uncertainty. Indeed, many of them have been used to

that end in previous studies.16
Finally, we should point out that ongoing high levels of uncertainty

do not bode well for a full and rapid economic recovery. Elevated uncer-
tainty generally makes firms and consumers cautious, retarding invest-
ment, hiring and expenditures on consumer durables ( see, for example,

Bernanke (1983), Dixit and Pindyck (1994), Abel and Eberly (1996) and

Bertola et al. (2005)). Given the scale of recent job losses and the col-
lapse in investment, a strong and rapid recovery would require a huge

surge in new activity, which sustained high levels of uncertainty (un-
precedented in recent history) will discourage.

Appendix A

To assess the impact of uncertainty shocks on real economic out-
comes, we fit VARs to monthly US data and adopt a Cholesky ordering

as follows: uncertainty measure; log(S&P500 stock market index), as
measured by the closing value on the last day of the previous month;

the effective Federal Funds Rate; log(manufacturing employment), sea-
sonally adjusted; and log(industrial production), seasonally adjusted.

The ordering and specification follow Baker et al. (2016). We detrend
all variables using the method of Hamilton (2018), with p = 36 and h
= 12.
We use four uncertainty measures: implied stock market volatility,
as measured by the one-month VIX (October 1966 to June 2020); the
model-based macro uncertainty measure of Jurado, Ludvigson and Ng
(October 1966 to April 2020); disagreement about US GDP growth

rates at a one-year forecast horizon in the Philly Fed's Survey of Profes-
sional Forecasters (August 1974 to May 2020); and the Baker-Bloom-
Davis newspaper-based measure of economic policy uncertainty

(April 1989 to Jun 2020). We linearly interpolate the once-per-quarter
forecast disagreement values to create a series at monthly frequency.

Fig. A5. Impact of uncertainty on output – reversed ordering. Note: The charts show VAR-estimated impulse response functions for industrial production to four uncertainty innovations

equal to the increase from January 2020 to their 2020 peaks (red lines), with 90% confidence bands, or to their 2008/09 peak (blue lines). We use the same detrending method, specifi-
cation, and data as in Fig. 8 in the main text, except for a different identification assumptions, with variables ordered as follows: log(industrial production), log(manufacturing employ-
ment), effective federal reserve funds rate, log(S&P 500 index), and uncertainty.
