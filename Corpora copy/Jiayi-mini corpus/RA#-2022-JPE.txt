Survey

In order to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher education, we surveyed approximately

1500 students at one of the largest public institutions in the United States using an instrument designed to re-
cover the causal impact of the pandemic on students' current and expected outcomes. Results show large nega-
tive effects across many dimensions. Due to COVID-19: 13% of students have delayed graduation, 40% have lost a

job, internship, or job offer, and 29% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly het-
erogeneous. One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4 hours per week due to COVID-19,

while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This heterogeneity often
followed existing socioeconomic divides. Lower-income students are 55% more likely than their higher-income
peers to have delayed graduation due to COVID-19. Finally, we show that the economic and health related shocks
induced by COVID-19 vary systematically by socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining
the large (and heterogeneous) effects of the pandemic.

1. Introduction
The disruptive effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have impacted

almost all sectors of our society. Higher education is no exception. Anec-
dotal evidence paints a bleak picture for both students and universities.

According to the American Council on Education, enrollment is likely to
drop by 15% in the fall of 2020, while at the same time many institutions
may have to confront demands for large tuition cuts if classes remain

virtual.1 In a similar vein, students face an increasingly uncertain envi-
ronment, where financial and health shocks (for example, lack of re-
sources to complete their studies or fear of becoming seriously sick),

along with the transition to online learning may have affected their

academic performance, educational plans, current labor market partici-
pation, and expectations about future employment.

This paper attempts to shed light on the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on college students. First, we describe and quantify the causal
effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on a wide set of students' outcomes/

expectations. In particular, we analyze enrollment and graduation deci-
sions, academic performance, major choice, study and social habits,

remote learning experiences, current labor market participation, and
expectations about future employment. Second, we study how these
effects differ along existing socioeconomic divides and whether the
pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities. Finally, we present
suggestive evidence on the mechanisms behind the heterogeneous

COVID-19 effects by quantifying the relationship between individual-
level (financial and health) shocks and students' academic decisions

and labor market expectations.
For this purpose, we surveyed about 1500 undergraduate students
at Arizona State University (ASU), one of the largest public universities

in the United States, in late April 2020. The survey was explicitly de-
signed to not only collect student outcomes and expectations after the

onset of the pandemic, but also to recover counterfactual outcomes in
the absence of the outbreak. Specifically, the survey asked students

about their current experiences/expectations and what those experi-
ences/expectations would have been had it not been for the pandemic.

Because we collect information conditional on both states of the world
(with the COVID-19 pandemic, and without) from each student, we

can directly analyze how each student believes COVID-19 has impacted
their current and future outcomes.2 For example, by asking students
about their current GPA in a post-COVID-19 world and their expected

GPA in the absence of COVID-19, we can back out the subjective treat-
ment effect of COVID-19 on academic performance. The credibility of

our approach depends on: (1) students having well-formed beliefs

about outcomes in the counterfactual scenario. This is a plausible as-
sumption in our context since the counterfactual state is a realistic and

relevant one - it was the status quo less than two months before the sur-
vey, and (2) there being no systematic bias in the reporting of the data -

an assumption that is implicitly made when using any survey data.3
Our findings on academic outcomes indicate that COVID-19 has led
to a large number of students delaying graduation (13%), withdrawing
from classes (11%), and intending to change majors (12%). Moreover,
approximately 50% of our sample separately reported a decrease in

study hours and in their academic performance. Predicting the longer-
term impact of the pandemic on student achievement is more difficult,

but students reported that they expect to take a break from college in

the fall 2020 semester at more than twice the rate in previous years. His-
torically, 28% of students who fail to re-enroll do not return to ASU or

another university after 5 years (authors' calculations from ASU first-
time freshmen transcript data for the 2012–2014 spring semesters),

suggesting that the pandemic may have a lasting impact on the educa-
tional achievement of current students. We also find that students re-
port a decreased preference for online instruction as a result of their

recent experiences.
As expected, the COVID-19 outbreak also had large negative effects
on students' current labor market participation and expectations

about post-college labor outcomes.Working students suffered a 31% de-
crease in their wages and a 37% drop in weekly hours worked, on aver-
age. Moreover, around 40% of students lost a job, internship, or a job

offer, and 61% reported to have a family member that experienced a re-
duction in income. The pandemic also had a substantial impact on stu-
dents' expectations about their labor market prospects post-college.

For example, their perceived probability of finding a job before gradua-
tion decreased by almost 20%, and their expected earnings when 35

years old (around 15 years from the outbreak) declined by approxi-
mately 2.5%. This last finding suggests that students expect the pan-
demic to have a long-lasting impact on their labor market prospects,

which is qualitatively consistent with the literature on graduating dur-
ing a recession. For instance, Oreopoulos et al. (2012) and Schwandt

and von Wachter (2019) find significant reductions in earnings 5 and
10 years after graduation, respectively, and Kahn (2010) finds an even

longer-lasting effect on wages. On the other hand, although we are mea-
suring the probability of finding a job before graduating, not unemploy-
ment directly, our estimated quantitative effect on students'

expectations of finding a job seems to be larger relative to the literature
(Kahn, 2010; Altonji et al., 2016; and Rothstein, 2020).
The data also show that while all subgroups of the population have
experienced negative effects due to the outbreak, the size of the effects
are heterogeneous. For example, compared to their more affluent peers,
lower-income students are 55% more likely to delay graduation due to
COVID-19 and are 41% more likely to report that COVID-19 impacted
their major choice. Further, COVID-19 nearly doubled the gap between

higher- and lower-income students' expected GPA.4 There also is sub-
stantial variation in the pandemic's effect on preference for online learn-
ing, with Honors students and males revising their preferences down

more than 2.5 times as much as their peers. However, despite appearing

to be more disrupted by the switch to online learning, the impact of
COVID-19 on Honors students' academic outcomes is consistently
smaller than the impact on non-Honors students.

Finally, we evaluate the extent to which mitigating factors associ-
ated with more direct economic and health shocks from the pandemic

(for example, a family member losing income due to COVID-19, or the
expected probability of hospitalization if contracting COVID-19) can
explain the heterogeneity in pandemic effects. We find that both types
of shock (economic and health) are systematically correlated with
students' COVID-19 experiences. For example, the expected probability
of delaying graduation due to COVID-19 increases by approximately
25% if either a student's subjective probability of being late on a debt
payment in the following 90 days (a measure of financial fragility) or
subjective probability of requiring hospitalization conditional on
contracting COVID-19 increases by one standard deviation. As expected,
the magnitude of health and economic shocks are not homogeneous
across the student population. The average of the principal component
for the economic and health shocks is about 0.3–0.4 standard deviations
higher for students from lower-income families. Importantly, we find

that the disparate economic and health impacts of COVID-19 can ex-
plain 40% of the delayed graduation gap (as well as a substantial part

of the gap for other outcomes) between lower- and higher-income stu-
dents. This analysis should be viewed as descriptive in nature and not

necessarily causal, since omitted factors that are correlated both with
the shocks and the outcomes may be driving these relationships.
To our knowledge, this is the first paper to shed light on the effects of
COVID-19 on college students' experiences. The treatment effects that
we find are large in economic terms. Whether students are overreacting
in their response to the COVID-19 shock is not clear. We do find that
previous cumulative GPA is a strong predictor of expected semester
GPA without COVID-19, suggesting that students' reported expectations
are meaningful. However, we know that individuals generally tend to
overweight recent experiences (Malmendier and Nagel, 2016; Kuchler
and Zafar, 2019). Whether students' subjective treatment effects are
“correct” in some ex-post sense is beside the point. As long as students
are reporting their subjective beliefs without any systematic bias, it is
the perceived treatment effects, not actual ones, – regardless of whether
they are correct or not – which are fundamental to understanding

choices. For example, if students (rightly or wrongly) perceive a nega-
tive treatment effect of COVID-19 on the returns to a college degree,

this belief will have an impact on their future human capital decisions
(such as continuing with their education, choice of major, etc.).
Our results underscore the fact that the COVID-19 shock is likely to

exacerbate socioeconomic disparities in higher education. This is consis-
tent with findings regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on K-12 students.

Kuhfeld et al. (2020) project that school closures are likely to lead to
significant learning losses in math and reading. However, they estimate
heterogeneous effects, and conclude that high-performing students
are likely to make gains. Likewise, Chetty et al. (2020) find that,
post-COVID, student progress on an online math program decreased

significantly more in poorer ZIP codes. Our analysis reveals that the het-
erogeneous economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19 can

partially explain these varying impacts. This suggests that by addressing
the economic and health impacts imposed by COVID-19, policy makers
may be able to prevent COVID-19 from widening existing gaps in higher
education.
2. Data
2.1. Survey
Our data come from an original survey of undergraduate students at
Arizona State University (ASU), one of the largest public universities in
the United States. Like other higher educational institutions in the US,
the Spring 2020 semester started in person. However, in early March
during spring break, the school announced that instruction would be

2 In some cases, instead of asking students for the outcomes in both states of the world,
we directly ask for the difference. For example, the survey asked how the pandemic had
affected the student's graduation date.
3 This approach has been used successfully in several other settings, such as to construct
career and family returns to college majors (Arcidiacono et al., 2020; Wiswall and Zafar,
2020), and the causal impact of health on retirement (Shapiro and Giustinelli, 2019). 4 The income gap in GPA increased from 0.052 to 0.098 on a 4 point scale. It is significant
at the 1% level in both scenarios.

transitioned online and that students were advised not to return to
campus.
The study was advertised on the My ASU website, accessible only
through the student's ASU ID and password. Undergraduate students
were invited to participate in an online survey about their experiences
and expectations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, for which they
would be paid $10. The study was posted during the second to last
week of instruction for the spring semester (April 23rd). Our sample
size was constrained by the research funds to 1500 students, and the
survey was closed once the desired sample size was reached, which
happened within 3 days of posting the survey.

The survey was programmed in Qualtrics. It collected data on stu-
dents' demographics and family background, their current experiences

(both for academic outcomes and non-academic outcomes), and their

future expectations. Importantly for the purposes of this study, the sur-
vey collected data on what these outcomes/expectations would have

been in the counterfactual state, without COVID-19. The survey instru-
ment (with only the relevant sections) can be found here.

2.2. Sample
A total of 1564 respondents completed the survey.5 90 respondents
were ineligible for the study (such as students enrolled in graduate
degree programs or diploma programs) and were dropped from the

sample. Finally, responses in the 1st and 99th percentile of survey dura-
tion were further excluded, leading to a final sample size of 1446. The

survey took 38 min to complete, on average (median completion time
was 26 min).
The first five columns of Table 1 show how our sample compares

with the broader ASU undergraduate population and the average un-
dergraduate student at other large flagship universities (specifically,

the largest public universities in each state). Relative to the ASU under-
graduate population, our sample has a significantly higher proportion of

first-generation students (that is, students with no parent with a college

degree), and a smaller proportion of international students. The demo-
graphic composition of our sample compares reasonably well with that

of students in flagship universities. Our sample is also positively selected

in terms of SAT/ACT scores relative to these two populations. The sam-
ple may also differ from the student body at other large public schools in

that 30% report living on campus, which is not always the norm at other
large institutions and may play an important role in how disruptive the
pandemic has been.6
The better performance on admission tests could be explained by
the high proportion of Honors students in our sample (22% compared
to 18% in the ASU population). The last four columns of Table 1 show

how Honors students compare with ASU students and the average col-
lege student at a top-10 university. We see that they perform better

than the average ASU student (which is expected) and just slightly
worse than the average college student at a top-10 university. The
share of white Honors students in our sample (60%) is higher than the
proportion in the ASU population and much higher than the proportion
of white students in the top-10 universities.

Overall, we believe our sample of ASU students is a reasonable rep-
resentation of students at other large public schools, while the Honors

students may provide insight into the experiences of students at more

elite Institutions. Though, it is important to acknowledge that elite insti-
tutions may have additional resources to address a global pandemic.

3. Analytic framework

We next outline a simple analytic framework that guides the empir-
ical analysis. Let Oi(COVID – 19) be the potential outcome of individual i

associated with COVID-19 treatment. We are interested in the causal
impact of COVID-19 on student outcomes:
Δið Þ1⁄4 O Oið Þ COVID19 1⁄4 1 Oið Þ COVID19 1⁄4 0 ; ð1Þ
where the first term on the right-hand side is student i's outcome in the
state of the world with COVID-19, and the second term being student i's
outcome in the state of the world without COVID-19. Recovering the

treatment effect at the individual level entails comparison of the indi-
vidual's outcomes in two alternate states of the world. With standard

data on realizations, a given individual is observed in only one state of
the world (in our case, COVID– 19 = 1). The alternate outcomes are

counterfactual and unobserved. A large econometric and statistics liter-
ature studies how to identify these counterfactual outcomes and mo-
ments of the counterfactual outcomes (such as average treatment

effects) from realized choice data (e.g., Heckman and Vytlacil, 2005;

Angrist and Pischke, 2009; Imbens and Rubin, 2015). Instead, the ap-
proach we use in this paper is to directly ask individuals for their ex-
pected outcomes in both states of the world. From the collected data,

we can then directly calculate the individual-level subjective treatment
effect. As an example, consider beliefs about end-of-semester GPA.
The survey asked students “What semester-level GPA do you expect to
get at the end of this semester?” This is the first-term on the right-hand
side of Eq. (1). The counterfactual is elicited as follows “Were it not for
the COVID-19 pandemic, what semester-level GPA would you have
expected to get at the end of the semester?”. The difference in the

responses to these two questions gives us the subjective expected treat-
ment effect of COVID-19 on the student's GPA. For certain binary

outcomes in the survey, we directly ask students for the Δi. For example,
regarding graduation plans, we simply ask a student if the Δi is positive,
negative, or zero: “How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected your
graduation plan? [graduate later; graduation plan unaffected; graduate
earlier].”

The approach we use in this paper follows a small and growing liter-
ature that uses subjective expectations to understand decision-making

under uncertainty. Specifically, Arcidiacono et al. (2020) and Wiswall

and Zafar (2020) ask college students about their beliefs for several out-
comes associated with counterfactual choices of college majors, and es-
timate the ex-ante treatment effects of college majors on career and

family outcomes. Shapiro and Giustinelli (2019) use a similar approach
to estimate the subjective ex-ante treatment effects of health on labor
supply. There is one minor distinction from these papers: while these
papers elicit ex-ante treatment effects, in our case, we look at outcomes

that have been observed (for example, withdrawing from a course dur-
ing the semester) as well as those that will be observed in the future

(such as age 35 earnings). Thus, some of our subjective treatment effects
are ex-post in nature while others are ex-ante.

The soundness of our approach depends on a key assumption that stu-
dents have well-formed expectations for outcomes in both the realized

state and the counterfactual state. Since the outcomes we ask about are

absolutely relevant and germane to students, they should have well-
formed expectations for the realized state. In addition, given that the

counterfactual state is the one that had been the status quo in prior se-
mesters (and so students have had prior experiences in that state of the

world), their ability to have expectations for outcomes in the counterfac-
tual state should not be a controversial assumption.7 As evidence that stu-
dents' expectations exhibit meaningful variation, Appendix Fig. A1 shows

that previous cumulative GPA is a strong predictor of expected semester
GPA with COVID-19.

5 The 64 people taking the survey at the moment the target sample size (1500) was
reached were allowed to finish. 6 59% of Honors students in our sample report living on campus.

7 This is different from asking students in normal times about their expected outcomes
in a state with online teaching and no campus activities (COVID-19) since most students
would not have had any experience with this counterfactual prior to March this year.

4. Empirical analysis
4.1. Treatment effects
We start with the analysis of the aggregate-level treatment effects,
which are presented in Table 2. The outcomes are organized in two

groups, academic and labor market (see Appendix Table A1 for a com-
plete list of outcomes). The first two columns of the table show the av-
erage beliefs for those outcomes where the survey elicited beliefs in

both states of the world. The average treatment effects shown in column
(3) are of particular interest. Since we can compute the individual-level
treatment effects, columns (4)–(7) of the table show the cross-sectional
heterogeneity in the treatment effects.

We see that the average treatment effects are statistically and eco-
nomically significant for all outcomes. The average impacts on academic

outcomes, shown in Panel A, are mostly negative. For example, the aver-
age subjective treatment effect of COVID-19 on semester-level GPA is a

decline of 0.17 points. More than 50% of the students in our sample ex-
pect a decrease in their GPA due to the treatment (versus only 7%

expecting an increase). Additionally, 13% of the participants delayed
their graduation, 11% withdrew from a class during the spring semester,
and 12% stated that their major choice was impacted by COVID-19.8
While almost no students report planning to drop out due to
COVID-19, on average they expect to take a break from ASU in the fall

2020 semester at nearly twice the historical rate. Admittedly, the deci-
sion to take a break during a pandemic may be different than in more

normal times. However, a substantial increase in the share of students

failing to continue their studies is concerning, as historically 28% of stu-
dents who fail to re-enroll for a fall semester do not return to ASU or an-
other university within 5 years.

Regarding the impact of the pandemic on major choice, students
who report that COVID-19 impacted their major choice were more

likely to be in lower-paying majors before the pandemic; mean pre-
COVID major-specific annual earnings were $43,053 ($46,943) for stu-
dents whose major choice was (not) impacted by COVID-19.9 Impacted

students were also 9.3 percentage points less likely to be in a science,
technology, engineering, or math (STEM) major before COVID-19.10
We are only able to observe pre- and post-COVID major choices for
the subset of students who had switched their major by the date of
the survey.11 Within this selected subsample of switchers, students
chose to move into higher paying majors, with an average change in
first-year earnings of $3,340. These patterns are generally consistent
with the finding that students tend to gravitate towards higher-paying
majors when exposed to adverse economic conditions when in college
(Blom et al., 2019).
An interesting and perhaps unanticipated result reported in Table 2
is that, on average, students are 4 percentage points less likely to opt for

online instruction if given the choice between online and in-person in-
struction due to their experience with online instruction during the

pandemic.1213 However, there is a substantial amount of variation in
terms of the direction of the effect: 31% (47%) of the participants are
now more (less) likely to enroll in online classes. We explore this

8 Altonji et al. (2016) finds a small but positive effect on the probability of attending

graduate school when graduating into a recession. This is suggestive evidence that stu-
dents try to avoid entering the labor market when economic conditions are adverse. Our

results on delayed graduation are consistent with students avoiding entering the labor
market at inopportune times.

averaged within major category.

mester], what is the percent chance that you would opt for the online/remote option?” 13 This result is in line with a survey about eLearning experiences across different univer-
sities in Washington and New York that concludes that 75% of the students are unhappy

with the quality of their classes after moving to online learning due to COVID-19.

heterogeneity in more detail in the next section, but it seems that prior

experience with online classes somewhat ameliorates the negative ex-
perience; the average treatment effect for students with prior experi-
ence in online classes is a 2.4 percentage points decrease in their

likelihood of enrolling in online classes, versus a 9.5 percentage points
decline for their counterparts (difference statistically significant at the
0.1% level).
This large variation in the treatment effects of COVID-19 is apparent in
several of the other outcomes, such as study hours, where the average

treatment effect of COVID-19 on weekly study hours is −0.9 (that is, stu-
dents spend 0.9 less hours studying per week due to COVID-19). The in-
terquartile range of the across-subject treatment effect demonstrates

substantial variation, with the pandemic decreasing study time by 5
hours at the 25th percentile and increasing study time by 4 hours at
the 75th.
Overall, these results suggest that COVID-19 represents a substantial

disruption to students' academic experiences, and is likely to have last-
ing impacts through changes in major/career and delayed graduation

timelines. Students' negative experiences with online teaching, perhaps
due to the abruptness of the transition, also has implications for the
willingness of students to take online classes in the future.
Turning to Panel B in Table 2, we see that students' current and
expected labor market outcomes were substantially disrupted by

COVID-19. As for the extensive margin of current employment, on aver-
age, 29% of the students lost the jobs they were working at prior to the

pandemic (67% of the students were working prior to the pandemic),
13% of students had their internships or job offers rescinded, and 61%

of the students reported that a close family member had lost their job
or experienced an income reduction. The last statistic is in line with
findings from other surveys of widespread economic disruption across
the US.14 Respondents experienced an average decrease of 11.5 hours
of work per week and a 21% decrease in weekly earnings, although
there was no change in weekly earnings for 52% of the sample, which
again reflects substantial variation in the effects of COVID-19 across
students.
In terms of labor market expectations, on average, students foresee a
13 percentage points decrease in the probability of finding a job by

graduation, a reduction of 2% in their reservation wages, and a 2.3% de-
crease in their expected earnings at age 35.

The significant changes in reservation wages and expected earnings
at age 35 demonstrate that students expect the treatment effects of
COVID-19 to be long-lasting. Qualitatively, this is broadly consistent
with the literature on graduating during recession. Oreopoulos et al.

(2012) finds that graduating during a recession in which the unemploy-
ment rate increases 5% implies an initial loss in earnings of 9%, that de-
creases to 4.5% within 5 years and disappears after 10 years for a sample

of male college graduates in Canada. Similarly, Schwandt and von

Wachter (2019) find a 2.6% reduction in earnings 10 years after gradu-
ation for a 3-percentage point increase in unemployment at graduation,

and Kahn (2010) finds an even longer-lasting effect on wages.

A large literature has investigated the impact of graduating during
recessions on unemployment rates. Kahn (2010) finds that during the

1980's recession, the probability of being employed right after gradua-
tion for white males was largely unaffected by economic conditions.

Altonji et al. (2016) only find what they term modest impacts. On the

other hand, Rothstein (2020) finds that, for 22 to 23-year-olds graduat-
ing from college during the Great Recession, the probability of being

employed decreases by 0.7 percentage point for every 1 percentage
point increase in the unemployment rate. Using the estimates in
Rothstein (2020) and the approximate 10 percentage point increase in

the unemployment rate during April 2020, a back-of-the-envelope cal-
culation indicates a 7 percentage point reduction in the probability of

being employed for the graduating cohort in our sample. We find that

students who are graduating in spring or summer 2020 expect a 35 per-
centage point decline in the likelihood of finding a job before gradua-
tion. While it is difficult to precisely map pre-graduation job finding

rates to unemployment over the subsequent year, a 7 percentage
point increase in unemployment appears low compared to the impact

on students' expectations. It could be the case that the literature esti-
mates are not appropriate for a situation as unexpected and different

as a global pandemic, where the economic recession goes hand in

hand with health concerns. Having said that, it could also be that stu-
dents are overreacting to the COVID-19 shock. Data that tracks students'

expectations and outcomes over time may be able to shed light on this.
4.2. Heterogeneous effects
We next explore demographic heterogeneity in the treatment effects

of COVID-19. Fig. 1 plots the average treatment effects across several rel-
evant demographic divisions including gender, race, parental education,

and parental income. Honors college status and cohort are also included
as interesting dimensions of heterogeneity in the COVID-19 context.
The figure shows the impacts for six of the more economically meaningful
outcomes from Table 2 (additional outcomes can be found in Appendix
Fig. A2).
At least four patterns of note emerge from Fig. 1. First, compared to

their classmates, students from disadvantaged backgrounds (lower-in-
come students defined as those with below-median parental income,

racial minorities, and first-generation students) experienced larger neg-
ative impacts for the academic outcomes, as shown in the first three

panels of the figure.15 The trends are most striking for lower-income

students, who are 55% more likely to delay graduation due to COVID-
19 than their more affluent classmates (0.16 increase in the proportion

of those expecting to delay graduation versus 0.10), expect 30% larger
negative effects on their semester GPA due to COVID-19, and are 41%
more likely to report that COVID-19 impacted their major choice
(these differences are statistically significant at the 5% level). For some
academic outcomes, COVID-19 had similarly disproportionate effects
on nonwhite and first-generation students, with nonwhite students

being 70% more likely to report changing their major preference com-
pared to their white peers and first-generation students being 50%

more likely to delay their graduation than students with college-
educated parents. Thus, while on average COVID-19 negatively im-
pacted several measures of academic achievement for all subgroups,

the effects are significantly more pronounced for socioeconomic groups

which were predisposed towards worse academic outcomes pre-
COVID.16 The pandemic's widening of existing achievement gaps can

be seen directly in students' expected Semester GPA. Without COVID-
19, lower-income students expected a 0.052 lower semester GPA than

their higher-income peers. With COVID-19, this gap nearly doubles to
0.098.17
Second, Panel (d) of Fig. 1 shows that the switch to online learning
was substantially harder for some demographic groups; for example,
men are 7 percentage points less likely to opt for an online version of
a course as a result of COVID-19, while women do not have a statistically
significant change in their online preferences. We also see that Honors
students revise their preferences by more than 2.5 times the amount

of non-Honors students. As we show later (in Table 4), these gaps per-
sist after controlling for household income, major, and cohort, suggest-
ing that the switch to online learning mid-semester may have been

substantially more disruptive for males and Honors students. While
the effect of COVID-19 on preferences for online learning looks similar

for males and Honors students, our survey evidence indicates that dif-
ferent mechanisms underpin these shifts. Based on qualitative evidence,

it appears that Honors students had a negative reaction to the transition
to online learning because they felt less challenged, while males were
more likely to struggle with the learning methods available through

the online platform.18 One speculative explanation for the gender differ-
ence is that consumption value of college amenities is higher for men

(however, Jacob et al. (2018), find little gender difference in willingness
to pay for the amenities they consider).

The third trend worth highlighting from Fig. 1 is that Honors stu-
dents were better able to mitigate the negative effect of COVID-19 on

their academic outcomes (panels a, b, and c), despite appearing to be

more disrupted by the move to online learning (panel d). Honors stu-
dents report being less than half as likely as non-Honors students to

delay graduation and change their major due to COVID-19. Extrapolat-
ing from these patterns provides suggestive evidence that academic im-
pacts for students attending elite schools– the group more comparable

to these Honors students– are likely to have been small relative to the
impacts for the average student at large public schools.
Finally, the last two panels of Fig. 1 present the COVID effect on two

labor market expectations and show much less meaningful heterogene-
ity across demographic groups compared to the academic outcomes in

previous panels. This suggests that, while students believe COVID-19

will impact both their academic outcomes and future labor market out-
comes, they do not believe there is a strong connection between these

domains. Supporting this observation, the individual-specific treatment

effect on semester GPA is only weakly correlated with the individual-
specific treatment effects on finding a job before graduation (corr =

0.0497, p = 0.065) and expected earnings at 35 (corr = 0.0467, p =
0.077).
The one notable exception to the lack of heterogeneity in panels

(e) and (f) of Fig. 1 are seniors, who on average revised their subjec-
tive probability of finding a job before graduation three times as

much as other cohorts. Appendix Fig. A3 further breaks down the es-
timated COVID-19 effects by expected year of graduation. Perhaps

unsurprisingly, the 2020 cohort expects much larger effects on im-
mediate job market outcomes such as reservation wages and proba-
bility of finding a job before graduation. While average expected

changes to job market outcomes are noisier for academically youn-
ger students, perhaps reflecting additional uncertainty about the

longer-term impacts of COVID-19, they appear to anticipate mean-
ingful changes to their future labor market prospects. Conversely,

younger students also expected larger disruptions to academic out-
comes such as semester GPA and study time.

15 The cutoff for median parental income in our sample is $80,000. 16 Based on analysis of ASU administrative data including transcripts, we find that, rela-
tive to their counterparts, first-generation, lower-income, and non-white students drop

out at higher rates, take longer to graduate, have lower GPAs at graduation, and are more
likely to switch majors when in college (see Appendix Table A3).

17 The difference is significant at 1% in both cases. 18 Honors students were as likely as non-Honors students to say that classes got easier
after they went online but, conditional on saying classes got easier, were 47% more likely
to say “homework/test questions got easier.” Conversely, males were marginally more
likely to say classes got harder after they went online (10% more likely, p = 0.055) and,
conditional on this, were 14% more likely to say that “online material is not clear”.

5. Understanding the heterogeneous effects

This section presents mediation analysis on the drivers of the under-
lying heterogeneity in the treatment effects. The COVID-19 pandemic

serves as both an economic and a health shock. However, these shocks
may have been quite heterogeneous across the various groups, and

that could partly explain the heterogeneous treatment effects we docu-
mented in the previous section.

5.1. Economic and health mediating factors
We proxy for the financial and health shocks due to COVID-19 by
relying on a small but relevant set of covariates which capture more
fundamental or first-order disruptions from the pandemic. Financial
shocks are characterized based on whether a student lost a job due
to COVID-19, whether a student's family members lost income due
to COVID-19, the change in a student's monthly earnings due to

COVID-19, and the likelihood a student will fail to fully meet debt pay-
ments in the next 90 days. To measure health shocks, we consider a

student's belief about the likelihood that they will be hospitalized if
they contract COVID-19, a student's belief about the likelihood that

they will have contracted COVID-19 by summer, and a student's subjec-
tive health assessment. Finally, in order to summarize the combined ef-
fect of each set of proxies, we construct principal component scores as

one-dimensional measures of the financial and health shock to
students.19
Table 3 reports summary statistics of the different economic and

health proxies by demographic group. Given the results in Fig. 1, the re-
mainder of the analysis will focus on three socioeconomic divisions: pa-
rental income, gender, and Honors college status. Our data indicate that

lower-income students faced larger health and economic shocks as
compared to their more affluent peers. In particular, they are almost

10 percentage points more likely to expect to default on their debt pay-
ments compared to their higher-income counterparts. Additionally,

lower-income students are 16 percentage points more likely to have
had a close family member experience an income reduction due to
COVID-19. Regarding the health proxies, lower-income students rate
their health as worse than higher-income students and perceive a
higher probability of being hospitalized if they catch the virus. Finally,
the differences in economic and health shocks between lower and
higher-income students, as summarized by the principle components
of the selected proxy variables, are statistically significant.
Columns (5)–(7) of Table 3 show that both economic and health
shocks are larger for non-Honors students. In fact, the average differences

in the principal component scores for both the economic and health fac-
tors is larger for these two groups than for the income groups. Likewise,

the last three columns of the table show that women experienced larger
COVID-19 shocks due to economic and health factors. These differences
are partly driven by the fact that, in our sample, females are more likely
to report that they belong to a lower-income household than males
(50% vs. 42%).
In short, Table 3 makes clear that the impacts of COVID-19 on the

economic well-being and health of students have been quite heteroge-
neous, with lower-income and lower-ability students being more ad-
versely affected.

5.2. The role of economic and health shocks on explaining the COVID-19
effects
To investigate the role of economic and health shocks in explaining
the heterogeneous treatment effects (in Section 4.2), we estimate the
following specification:
Δi 1⁄4 α0 þ α1Demogi þ α2FinShocki þ α3HealthShocki þ εi; ð2Þ
where Δi is the COVID-19 treatment effect for outcome O on student i.
Demogi is a vector including indicators for gender, lower-income,
Honors status, and dummies for cohort year and major. FinShocki and
HealthShocki are vectors containing the shock proxies or their principal
component. Finally, εi denotes an idiosyncratic shock.
The parameters of interest are α2 and α3. A causal interpretation of
these parameters requires FinShocki and HealthShocki to be independent
of εi. This seems unlikely in our context as unobservables correlated
with FinShocki and HealthShocki may also modulate COVID-19's impact
on academic outcomes. Therefore, we prefer to interpret α2 and α3 as
simple correlations. Nevertheless, we believe this descriptive evidence
can be informative from a policy perspective.
Table 4 shows estimates of Eq. (2) for four different outcomes
(Appendix Table A2 shows the estimates for additional outcomes). For
each outcome, five specifications are reported ranging from controlling
for only demographic variables in the first specification to controlling
for both economic and health factors in the fourth specification. Finally,

19 Eigenvalues indicate the presence of only one principal component for each of the
shocks.

the last column includes only the principal component of each shock to
provide insight about overall effects, given that certain shock proxies

show high levels of correlation (see Appendix Table A4 for the correla-
tions within each set of proxies).

Several important messages emerge from Table 4. First, both
shocks are (economically and statistically) significant correlates of the
COVID-19 effects on students' outcomes. In particular, F-tests show
that the financial and health shock proxies are jointly significant across

almost all specifications.20 This is also reflected in the statistical signifi-
cance of the principal components. Moreover, the fact that the effect of

key proxy variables remains robust when we simultaneously control for
both shocks demonstrates the robustness of our results. For example,
we find that a 50 percentage point increase in the probability of being
late on debt payments is associated with an increase in the probability
of delaying graduation and switching majors due to COVID-19 of 6.9
and 6.4 percentage points respectively. These effects are large given
that they represent more than half of the overall COVID-19 treatment
effect for these variables. Similarly, we find that an analogous increase

in the probability of hospitalization if contracting COVID-19 is associ-
ated with a 6 and 5 percentage points increase in the probability of

delaying graduation and switching majors due to COVID-19.
Second, in terms of labor market expectations, we find that the
change in the expected probability of finding a job before graduation
strongly depends on having a family member that lost income
(which is also correlated with the student himself losing a job). In
particular, the size of this effect represents 32% of the overall

COVID-19 treatment effect. Therefore, this finding suggests that stu-
dents' labor market expectations are driven in large part by personal/

family experiences.
Third, although the proxies play an important role in explaining the

pandemic's impact on students, there is still a substantial amount of var-
iation in COVID-19 treatment effects left unexplained. Across the four

outcomes in Table 4, the full set of proxies explain less than a quarter

of the variation in outcomes across individuals. Appendix Fig. A4 visual-
izes this variation by plotting the distribution of several continuous

outcomes with and without controls. While the interquartile range no-
ticeably shrinks after conditioning on the proxy variables, these plots

highlight the large amount of variation in treatment effects remaining
after conditioning on the proxies.
Finally, our results show that the financial and health shocks play
an important role in explaining the heterogeneous effects of the

COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, columns (4) and (9) demonstrate

that economic and health factors together can explain approxi-
mately 40% and 70% of the income gap in COVID-19's effect on

delayed graduation and changing major respectively. The gap be-
tween Honors and non-Honors students is likewise reduced by 27%

and 39% for the same outcomes. Taken together, these results
imply that differences in the magnitude of COVID-19's economic

and health impact can explain a significant proportion of the demo-
graphic gaps in COVID-19's effect on the decision to delay gradua-
tion, the decision to change major, and preferences for online

learning. These results are important and suggest that focusing on
the needs of students who experienced larger financial or health

shocks from COVID-19 may be an effective way to minimize the dis-
parate disruptive effects and prevent COVID-19 from exacerbating

existing achievement gaps in higher education.
6. Conclusions
This paper provides the first systematic analysis of the effects of
COVID-19 on higher education. To study these effects, we surveyed
1500 students at Arizona State University, and present quantitative
evidence showing the negative effects of the pandemic on students'
outcomes and expectations. For example, we find that 13% of students
have delayed graduation due to COVID-19. Expanding upon these

results, we show that the effects of the pandemic are highly heteroge-
neous, with lower-income students 55% more likely to delay graduation

compared to their higher-income counterparts. We further show that

the negative economic and health impacts of COVID-19 have been sig-
nificantly more pronounced for less advantaged groups, and that

these differences can partially explain the underlying heterogeneity
that we document. Our results suggest that by focusing on addressing
the economic and health burden imposed by COVID-19, as measured
by a relatively narrow set of mitigating factors, policy makers may be
able to prevent COVID-19 from widening existing achievement gaps
in higher education.
