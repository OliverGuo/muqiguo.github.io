SUMMARY 
Testosterone de.ciency can lead to depressive symptoms in humans; however, the causes of this de.ciency are incompletely understood. Here, we isolated Mycobacterium neoaurum from the fecal samples of testos-terone-de.cient patients with depression and showed that this strain could degrade testosterone in vitro. Furthermore, gavaging rats with M. neoaurum reduced their serum and brain testosterone levels and induced depression-like behaviors. We identi.ed the gene encoding 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3b-HSD) as the enzyme causing testosterone degradation. Introducing 3b-HSD into Escherichia coli enhanced its ability to degrade testosterone. Gavaging rats with 3b-HSD-producing E. coli reduced their serum and brain testos-terone levels and caused depression-like behaviors. Finally, compared with 16.67% of participants without depression, 42.99% (46/107) of the fecal samples of patients with depression harbored 3b-HSD, and 60.87% (28/46) of these fecal samples expressed 3b-HSD. These results suggest that 3b-HSD expressed by gut mi-crobes may be associated with depressive symptoms due to testosterone degradation. 
INTRODUCTION 
Depressive disorders are a major public health concern. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that depres-sive disorders became the leading cause of disability worldwide (W.H.O., 
2017). The incidence of depression in men increases with age-related decline in testosterone levels (Bhasin 
and 
Seid-
man, 
2019; Wu 
et 
al., 
2010). However, testosterone de.ciency also occurs in young men and is associated with depressive symptoms (Bremner, 
2010). In the United States of America, testosterone de.ciency occurs in approximately 6% of the gen-eral male population (aged 30 to 79 years) (Araujo 
et 
al., 
2007). Sometimes, testosterone de.ciency can be a primary manifesta-tion (e.g., mumps orchitis and Klinefelter¡¯s syndrome), and in others, it may be a secondary manifestation (e.g., pituitary injury and excessive hunger) (Basaria, 
2014). However, the causes of testosterone de.ciency in patients with depression have not been clari.ed. 
Testosterone is a neuroactive steroid hormone produced by the testis, adrenal glands, and adipose tissue (Baulieu, 
1991). 
After being metabolized by the liver, testosterone is excreted through the bile into the gut, and then 83% of it is reabsorbed into the blood (Sandberg 
and 
Slaunwhite, 
1956). Recently, it was reported that gut microbes in.uence the levels of some ste-roid hormones by shifting the ratio of active and inactive forms of the steroid hormones (Needham 
et 
al., 
2020). Therefore, ste-roid hormone metabolism by gut microbes may in.uence the onset or treatment of certain diseases. For example, the gut mi-crobiota contribute to endocrine resistance in castration-resis-tant prostate cancer by providing an alternative source of an-drogens (Pernigoni 
et 
al., 
2021). The gut microbiota of patients with depressive disorders differ signi.cantly from those of healthy controls and are characterized by increased abun-dances of Proteobacteria (Jiang 
et 
al., 
2015), Actinobacteria (Sharon 
et 
al., 
2016), and Bacteroides (Zheng 
et 
al., 
2016). In diverse natural environments, Proteobacteria and Actinobacte-ria have been identi.ed as steroid degraders (Holert 
et 
al., 
2018). Thus, the gut microbiota in patients with depression are likely to have a stronger ability to degrade steroids than those in normal individuals.

OPEN ACCESS 
Given that testosterone is a steroid hormone, we hypothesized that some microbes in the gut of patients with depression may degrade testosterone, resulting in decreased serum testos-terone levels and subsequent depression. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the relationships among testosterone de.-ciency, depression, and the gut microbiota. 
RESULTS 
Testosterone de.ciency in participants with and without depression 
To explore the incidence of testosterone de.ciency in patients with depression, psychiatric in patients who met the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymic disor-der from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Psychiatric Diseases (DSM-V) were included in the depression group (n = 77). Healthy participants who did not meet the DSM-V diag-nostic criteria for MDD or dysthymic disorder were included in the non-depression group (n = 102). 
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS) was conducted to quantify the serum testosterone levels in the 2 groups. The average serum testosterone level was signif-icantly higher in the non-depression group (549.24 ¡À 269.16 ng/ dL) than in the depression group (312.97 ¡À 173.18 ng/dL; p < 0.001; Figure 
S1A). According to the European Association of Urology, European Academy of Andrology, and International Society of Andrology, testosterone thresholds for the diagnosis of testosterone de.ciency are less than 350 ng/dL (Aversa 
and 
Morgentaler, 
2015). The incidence rates of testosterone de.-ciency in the depression and non-depression groups were 54.55% (42/77) and 11.76% (12/102), respectively. Antidepres-sants affect serum testosterone levels because .uoxetine, ven-lafaxine, and ketamine decrease the testosterone levels after treatment in men whereas amitriptyline and imipramine could increase testosterone levels (Pavlidi 
et 
al., 
2021). Therefore, we excluded 47 patients from the depression group who used antidepressants and found that the incidence of testos-terone de.ciency was 30.00% (9/30) in untreated patients with depression. 
Fecal transplantation from patients with depression induced depression-like behavior in rats 
To investigate whether the gut microbiota from patients with depression could degrade testosterone, we cultured the gut mi-crobiota with testosterone (2 g/L). A thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis showed that in 83% (5/6) of the depressed pa-tients, the feces can degrade testosterone into androstenedione (AD), and in 67% (4/6) of depressed patients, feces can further degrade AD. All (6/6) feces samples from the non-depressed group showed no obvious testosterone degradation (Figure 
S2). 
Furthermore, to determine whether the gut microbiota from patients with depression could decrease testosterone levels and cause depression-like behavior, we performed fecal trans-plantation by gavage. The rats were divided into the following 3 groups: (1) control group, administered 1 mL of saline by gavage once daily for 3 successive days; (2) non-depression mi-crobiota group, transplantation with 1 mL of the gut microbiota from a non-depressive participant once daily for 3 successive days; and (3) depression microbiota group, transplantation

with 1 mL of the gut microbiota from a depressive patient once daily for 3 successive days (Figure 
1A). 
Because all the rats were treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) in their drinking water for 1 week to deplete the gut micro-biota before gavage, which may affect the level of serum testos-terone, we detected the level of serum testosterone between un-treated rats and ABX-treated rats. Four weeks after treatment, there was no obvious difference between the 2 groups (Fig-
ure 
S1B), which further shows that ABX treatment had no in.u-ence on the level of serum testosterone in this condition. Then, we gavaged the ABX-treated rats with the gut microbiota from participants; the quanti.cation of serum testosterone using LC-MS/MS showed that the serum testosterone levels in the depres-sion microbiota group were signi.cantly lower than those in the control group (118 ¡À 31 ng/dL versus 232 ¡À 90 ng/dL; p = 0.018; Figure 
1B) and non-depression microbiota group (118 ¡À 31 ng/dL versus 225 ¡À 75 ng/dL; p = 0.033; Figure 
1B). Next, we quanti.ed the level of brain testosterone using LC-MS/MS and showed that the brain testosterone levels in the depression microbiota group were statistically signi.cantly lower than those in the control group (5.04 ¡À 2.37 ng/g versus 12.61 ¡À 3.78 ng/g; p = 0.042; Figure 
1C) and non-depression microbiota group 
(5.04 ¡À 2.37 ng/g versus 14.39 ¡À 7.16 ng/g; p = 0.012; Figure 
1C). 
Behavioral experiments showed that in the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), the immobility time of the rats in the depression microbiota group was longer than that of the rats in the control and non-depression microbiota groups, and in the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) and splash tests, the latent time of the rats in the depression microbiota group was longer than that of the rats in the control and non-depression microbiota groups (Figures 
1D and S3A¨CS3C). 
These results suggested that the microbiota from patients with depression can decrease the levels of serum and brain testos-terone and induce depression-like behavior in rats. 
Isolation of testosterone-degrading bacteria from testosterone-de.cient patients with depression 
Because the degradation of testosterone by gut microbes can reduce serum testosterone, we used testosterone as the sole carbon source (Yang 
et 
al., 
2011) to culture the feces of an un-treated patient with depression; we isolated several bacteria, but only one could degrade testosterone (Figure 
2A). Then, we performed sequencing analysis for its identi.cation. In the phylo-genetic tree, the 16S rRNA sequence of the strain displayed sim-ilarities of 99.0%¨C99.8% to Mycobacterium neoaurum and 98.6%¨C99.7% to other species of Mycobacterium. We named this strain M. neoaurum MN2019. Although M. neoaurum was isolated using testosterone as the sole carbon source, this strain can also grow in a medium with a general carbon source, such as in Luria-Bertani (LB) or blood agar plates. Drug sensitivity tests showed that M. neoaurum MN2019 was sensitive to erythro-mycin and amikacin; the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of erythromycin in M. neoaurum was 0.25 mg/L and that of amikacin in M. neoaurum was 0.75 mg/L (Figure 
S4A). 
M. neoaurum was originally isolated from soil in 1972 (Tsuka-
mura, 
1972) and has also been identi.ed in clinical infections, such as bloodstream infections (Washer 
et 
al., 
2007), prosthetic valve endocarditis (Kumar 
et 
al., 
2014), vascular catheter infec-tions (George 
and 
Schlesinger, 
1999), and pulmonary infections

(Morimoto 
et 
al., 
2007). Although M. neoaurum can transform several sterols (Wei 
et 
al., 
2010), its ability to degrade testos-terone has not been reported. 
We used a fermentation medium for sterol degradation and added testosterone (2 g/L) as the carbon source for assisted growth to verify the degradation ability of M. neoaurum, in accor-dance with a previous study (Sun 
et 
al., 
2019). TLC results showed that compared with those of the standards, the testos-terone levels gradually decreased and the levels of AD, the main product, gradually increased (Figure 
S4B). High-perfor-mance liquid chromatography (HPLC) quantitative analysis showed that the testosterone levels decreased. After 96 h of cul-ture, the testosterone level decreased by 91.78%. Metabolites included AD, androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD), and 9a-hy-droxyandrosta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (Figures 
2B and 2C). The main metabolite was AD, accounting for 91.85% of all metabo-lites (Figure 
2C). These results indicated that testosterone could be degraded by M. neoaurum. 
Gavage of M. neoaurum induced depression-like behavior in rats 
To explore whether M. neoaurum in the gut could cause depres-sion-like behavior, we administered M. neoaurum by gavage to rats. The rats were divided into the following 3 groups: (1) control group, administered 1 mL of saline by gavage once daily for 3 successive days; (2) M. neoaurum-recipient group, administered 
M. neoaurum (approximately 1 3 108 colony-forming units [cfu] once daily for 3 successive days); and (3) erythromycin treatment group, treated with erythromycin (10 mg/kg once daily for 7 suc-cessive days) after the oral administration of M. neoaurum (Figure 
3A). 
The quanti.cation of the serum testosterone levels using LC-MS/MS showed that the serum testosterone levels in 
M. neoaurum-recipient rats were signi.cantly lower than those in the control group (93 ¡À 75 ng/dL versus 243 ¡À 104 ng/dL; p = 0.002; Figure 
3B). Next, we quanti.ed the level of brain testosterone using LC-MS/MS and showed that brain testos-terone levels in M. neoaurum-recipient rats were statistically signi.cantly lower than those in the control group (4.56 ¡À 
3.07 ng/g versus 12.41 ¡À 4.67 ng/g; p < 0.001; Figure 
3C). 
Behavioral experiments showed that in the TST and FST, the immobility time of the M. neoaurum-recipient rats was longer than that of the control rats, and in the NSF and splash tests, the latent time of the M. neoaurum-recipient rats was longer than that of the control rats (Figures 
3D and S3D¨CS3F). To eval-uate the survival of M. neoaurum following oral gavage, we

cultured the feces of the M. neoaurum-recipient rats after the behavioral test, and colonies looking like M. neoaurum were iso-lated and further identi.ed using 16S rRNA sequencing for con.rmation. However, no M. neoaurum was isolated from the feces of the control rats. Next, we also performed real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on total RNA extracted from the feces of the M. neoaurum-recipient rats. We selected speci.c marker genes for M. neoaurum (Data 
S1) to design speci.c primers for M. neoaurum and showed that the gene transcript was in the gut of the M. neoaurum-recipient rats (n = 12) and not in the gut of the control rats (n = 12) (Figures 
S5A and S5B). These results demonstrate that M. neoaurum sur-vived in the gut of the M. neoaurum-recipient rats, from gavage to the behavioral test. 
To determine whether antibiotic treatment could alleviate the serum testosterone de.ciency and depression-like behaviors of the M. neoaurum recipients, we administered erythromycin for 1 week (10 mg/kg daily) by gavage (Figure 
3A). Two weeks af-ter erythromycin gavage, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that the level of serum testosterone in the M. neoaurum recipients treated with erythromycin (238 ¡À 115 ng/dL) recovered to the level of that in the control group (243 ¡À 104 ng/dL; p = 0.994; Figure 
3B). We also quanti.ed the level of brain testosterone using LC-MS/MS and showed that the level of brain testosterone in the 
M. neoaurum recipients treated with erythromycin (11.45 ¡À 
4.78 ng/g) recovered to the level of that in the control group 
(12.41 ¡À 4.67 ng/g; p = 0.844; Figure 
3C). 
In behavioral experiments, the immobility time in the FST and TST and the latent time in the NSF and splash tests were similar in the erythromycin-treated M. neoaurum rats and control rats. These results indicated that the depression-like behavior of the 
M. neoaurum recipients was alleviated after erythromycin treat-ment (Figures 
3D and S3D¨CS3F). To determine whether erythro-mycin treatment affects the survival of M. neoaurum, we cultured the feces of the erythromycin-treated M. neoaurum rats after the behavioral test, and no M. neoaurum were isolated. Next, we per-formed qRT-PCR on the total RNA content extracted from the feces of the erythromycin-treated M. neoaurum rats and showed that the gene was not transcript in the gut of the erythromycin-treated M. neoaurum rats (n = 12) (Figure 
S5C). These results demonstrate that M. neoaurum were killed by erythromycin. 
These data showed that gavage with M. neoaurum decreased the serum and brain testosterone levels and induced depres-sion-like behaviors in rats. Moreover, supplementation with erythromycin normalized the testosterone levels and behavior. 
Identi.cation of the key enzyme mediating testosterone degradation in M. neoaurum 
We reasoned that the effects of M. neoaurum gavage on depres-sion-like behaviors could be attributed to its capacity to degrade testosterone; therefore, we hypothesized that the construction of a testosterone-degrading strain by introducing a testos-terone-degrading enzyme gene could induce depression-like behaviors after its administration by gavage in rats. To construct recombinant Escherichia coli, we attempted to .nd the gene sequence of a testosterone-degrading enzyme in M. neoaurum. 
Information on steroid degradation was processed using BLAST from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (https://www.kegg.jp/)(Moriya 
et 
al., 
2007). Unfortu-nately, the testosterone-degrading enzyme 3b/17b-hydroxyste-roid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.51) has not been identi.ed in 
M. neoaurum VKM Ac-1815D. Therefore, we next sequenced the genome of M. neoaurum MN2019. In the M. neoaurum MN2019 chromosome (66.26% GC content in nucleobase,

accession number: CP074376), the gene MN2019_09885, en-coding 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3b-HSD), was identi-.ed via annotation (Figure 
4A; Data 
S2). To construct a testos-terone-degrading strain, the pET28a containing MN2019_ 09885 gene was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and 
E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 was obtained (Figure 
S6A). The vector pET28a was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to construct E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a as a control (Figure 
S6B). Using PCR, we veri.ed that the MN2019_09885 gene was found in E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 but not in E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a (Figure 
S6C). 
Subsequently, we incubated E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 or E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a with testosterone (2 g/L) in LB medium. TLC analysis showed that, compared with the standards, E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 transformed testosterone into AD in a time-depen-dent manner (Figure 
S6D). In contrast, testosterone was not transformed by E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a (Figure 
S6E). The me-tabolites were identi.ed using LC-MS/MS, which con.rmed that the product of testosterone degradation by E. coli BL21 (DE3)/ pDL01 was AD (Figure 
4B). Testosterone and AD levels were quanti.ed using HPLC, and E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 could convert 71.20% of testosterone into AD within 24 h and 89.41% of testosterone into

To explore the activity of the 3b-HSD protein encoded by the MN2019_ 09885 gene, we overexpressed 3b-HSD with His-Tag in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and puri.ed the enzyme using Ni-NTA column. The puri.ed-enzyme (Figure 
S6F) kinetic con-stants kcat and KM for testosterone hydroxysteroid dehydroge-nase reactions were determined (Figure

0.017 min , 101.9 ¡À 25.46 mM, and 0.002 min mM , respec-tively, for 3b oxidation. In a previous study, the kcat, KM, and kcat/KM values of the 17b-HSD from Comamonas testoster-oni were 0.0012 ¡À 0.0002 min 1, 11.8 ¡À 2.0 mM, and 0.0001 min 1 mM 1, respectively (Benach 
et 
al., 
2002), indicating that 3b-HSD in M. neoaurum had a higher testos-terone degradation activity. These data showed that the MN2019_09885 gene in M. neoaurum would express 3b-HSD in E. coli.

Experimental timeline for the control rats, E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients, E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a recipients, E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients treated with testosterone, and the AD-treated rats. All rats (aged 7 weeks) were treated with 7-day antibiotics followed by 1-day autoclaved water before being gavaged. The control rats were gavaged with saline (1 mL) for 3 successive days. The E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients and E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a re-cipients were gavaged with E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 or E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a (approximately 1 3 108 cfu) for 3 successive days. The E. coli BL21 (DE3)/ pDL01 recipients treated with testosterone (E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01+testosterone) were treated with 0.5 mg testosterone daily for 28 days by gavage at the beginning of the day, after E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 gavage. The AD-treated rats (AD) were treated with AD (0.5 mg/day for 28 days) by gavage, without any bacterial gavage. Four weeks after the .rst day of gavage, behavioral observation of rats was performed within a week, followed by testosterone levels mea-surement and 3b-HSD detection. BA, behavior assays.

E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01: plasmid pDL01, which contained 3b-HSD, was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3). E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a: vector plasmid pET28a was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Data are presented as mean levels ¡À SEM, and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey¡¯s multiple comparisons tests was performed to calculate statistical signi.cance (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

Next, we quanti.ed the level of brain testosterone using LC-MS/ MS and showed that the brain testosterone levels in the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients were signi.cantly lower than those in the control group (5.04 ¡À 2.28 ng/g versus 14.03 ¡À 5.01 ng/g; p < 0.001; Figure 
5C) and E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a recipients 
(5.04 ¡À 2.28 ng/g versus 14.27 ¡À 4.91 ng/g; p < 0.001; Figure 
5C). 
Behavioral experiments showed that in the FST and TST, the immobility time of the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients was longer than that of the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a recipients and the control rats. In the NSF and splash tests, the latent time was longer in the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients than in the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a recipients and control rats (Figures 
5D and S3G¨CS3I). No signi.cant depression-like behaviors were observed in the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a recip-ients compared with the control rats (Figures 
5D and S3G¨CS3I). Next, to verify whether 3b-HSD is expressed during the experi-ment, we conducted a western blot using the protein obtained from feces samples after behavioral assays. No obvious bands in the samples from the rats gavaged with E. coli BL21(DE3)/ pET28a recipients were observed, whereas bands were observed in the samples from the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 re-cipients (Figures 
S6G and S6H), suggesting that the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients expressed 3b-HSD during the experiment. 
Taken together, these results indicated that expression of 3b-HSD in the gut could degrade serum and brain testosterone to induce depression-like behaviors in rats. 
Testosterone supplementation alleviated depression-like behaviors in E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients 
To further evaluate the roles of testosterone de.ciency in the depression-like behaviors of the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01

recipients, we determined whether testosterone supplementa-tion could alleviate these phenotypes. The E. coli BL21 (DE3)/ pDL01 recipients were treated with 0.5 mg testosterone daily for 28 days by gavage, beginning from the day after the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 gavage (Spritzer 
et 
al., 
2011; Figure 
5A). 
The quanti.cation of serum testosterone using LC-MS/MS demonstrated that the testosterone levels in E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients (289 ¡À 101 ng/dL) were restored to the level of those in the control rats (246 ¡À 134 ng/dL) after testos-terone supplementation (Figure 
5B). The brain testosterone levels in the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients (12.44 ¡À 
3.32 ng/g) were restored to the level of those in the control rats 
(14.03 ¡À 5.01 ng/g, p = 0.989) (Figure 
5C). Results from the behavioral experiments showed that the immobility time in the FST and TST and the latent time in the NSF and splash tests in the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients with testosterone were similar to those of the control rats (Figures 
5D and S3G¨CS3I), which suggested that testosterone supplementation could alle-viate depression-like behaviors in the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients. Next, to verify whether 3b-HSD is expressed during the experiment, we conducted western blotting using the protein obtained from feces samples after behavioral assays. Bands were observed in the samples from the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/ pDL01 recipients treated with testosterone (Figure 
S6I), suggest-ing that 3b-HSD was expressed in the gut of rats during the experiment. 
Because 3b-HSD converts testosterone to AD, there are at least 3 situations that cause depression-like behaviors in the 
E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients: (1) testosterone de.ciency induces depression-like behaviors, (2) elevated serum AD levels induce depression-like behaviors, and (3) both testosterone de.-ciency and elevated serum AD levels induce depression-like be-haviors. The relationship between testosterone de.ciency and depression-like behaviors has been reported in a previous study (Carrier 
and 
Kabbaj, 
2012). Therefore, based on this study, we supplemented ABX-treated rats with AD (0.5 mg/day for

28 days) by gavage to further elucidate the associations between 3b-HSD and depression-like behaviors. 
In behavioral experiments, the immo-bility time in the FST and TST and the latent time in the NSF and splash tests for the AD-treated rats were similar to those of the control rats (Figures 
5D and S3G¨CS3I). 
This suggested that AD supplementation 
did not lead to depression-like behaviors in rats. Therefore, the expression of 3b-HSD in the gut may cause depression-like behavior in rats by reducing their testosterone levels. 
M. neoaurum and 3b-HSD were prevalent in patients with depression 
To assess the prevalence of M. neoaurum and 3b-HSD in the hu-man gut, we examined the metagenomic prevalence of 
M. neoaurum and 3b-HSD in the fecal DNA of the participants without (n = 102) and with depression (n = 107) using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The genes of M. neoaurum and 3b-HSD were ampli.ed using speci.c and degenerate primers, respectively. For the degenerate primer of the enzyme, MN2019_09885 sequences were compared using BLAST, and all homologous genes were selected to design primers for the conserved regions. 
The results showed that M. neoaurum was present in 4.67% (5/107) of the patients in the depression group and in none of the patients in the non-depression group. Moreover, 3b-HSD was present in 42.99% (46/107) of the patients in the depression group and 16.67% (17/102) of the patients in the non-depression group (Figure 
6A). These data suggested that M. neoaurum mainly existed in the patients with depression and that 3b-HSD was distributed more widely in the patients with depression than in healthy individuals. Furthermore, the distribution of 3b-HSD was more extensive than that of M. neoaurum, indi-cating that M. neoaurum may not be the only bacterium express-ing 3b-HSD in the gut. 
Next, to investigate the expression level of 3b-HSD in the par-ticipants without (n = 102) and with depression (n = 107), we used qRT-PCR to test the fecal RNA. The result showed that 3b-HSD was transcribed in 26.17% (28/107) of the patients in the depres-sion group and 4.90% (5/102) of the participants in the non-depression group (Figure 
6A). Upon comparing these results with the qPCR data, we observed that 60.87% (28/46) of the pa-tients with depression showed the transcription of 3b-HSD in

Article 
their gut, whereas this percentage was 29.41% (5/17) in the non-depression group, which suggests that the testosterone-de-grading bacteria in patients with depression are more active in expressing 3b-HSD. 
To explore the relationship between 3b-HSD and serum testosterone, correlation analyses were conducted. The result shows that both Ct values of 3b-HSD DNA (r = 0.257; p = 0.001; Figure 
6B) and 3b-HSD RNA (r = 0.266; p < 0.001; Fig-
ure 
6C) were positively associated with serum testosterone, which suggests that serum testosterone could be affected by gut 3b-HSD. 
DISCUSSION 
The idea that testosterone de.ciency can lead to depressive dis-orders was proposed over 50 years ago; however, relatively few studies have investigated the causes of testosterone de.ciency. Diczfalusy 
et 
al. 
(1962) 
found for the .rst time that steroid hor-mones can be converted into other products in the intestine, re-sulting in less reabsorption of steroid hormones into the blood (Diczfalusy 
et 
al., 
1962). Moreover, recent studies suggest that gut microbes can change the ratio of active and inactive forms of steroid hormones through the degradation pathway, thus affecting the levels of some steroid hormones (Needham 
et 
al., 
2020). However, the role of gut microbes in the metabolism of testosterone in the pathogenesis of depression has not yet been studied. In this study, we found that gut microbes could reduce the serum and brain testosterone levels by degrading testosterone and lead to depressive symptoms. 
Our results provided evidence for a previously unknown mechanism, i.e., the relationship between the gut microbiota and testosterone levels of serum and brain. It has been reported that the serum testosterone level of female mice administered with adult male cecal contents by gavage increased signi.cantly (Markle 
et 
al., 
2013). This indicates that gut microbes can change the testosterone level. In this study, M. neoaurum, which can degrade testosterone, reduced the testosterone levels of serum and brain, possibly because testosterone is degraded by 3b-HSD produced by M. neoaurum before it is reabsorbed into circulation. The presence of M. neoaurum MN2019 was not sur-prising because Mycobacteria have been reported to use natural sterols or some other steroidal compounds as sole energy and carbon sources (Yao 
et 
al., 
2014). M. neoaurum is a rapidly growing Mycobacterium and can degrade natural steroids (Vo.shvillo 
et 
al., 
2003). In addition, M. neoaurum NwIB-01 was isolated from soil using steroids as the sole carbon source (Wei 
et 
al., 
2010) and was found to convert phytosterols into AD, ADD, and 9a-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,17-dione (Yao 
et 
al., 
2014). Notably, M. neoaurum is currently used in the pharmaceu-tical industry to produce AD or ADD by phytosterol degradation (Rodr¡äguez-Garc¡äa 
et 
al., 
2016). Because the engineered E. coli that expressed 3b-HSD in the gut resulted in depression-like be-haviors in rats, we speculate that the bacteria expressing 3b-HSD in the gut may have the common feature of reducing serum testosterone and resulting in host depression. These data demonstrated a role for the gut-microbiota degradation of testosterone in depression-like behaviors and provided a ge-netic basis for understanding testosterone-de.ciency-related depressive disorders. AD is a weakly active form of testosterone OPEN ACCESS 
and has a lower af.nity for androgen receptor (Young 
et 
al., 
2013). Therefore, when testosterone is converted into a weakly active form by 3b-HSD in the gut, the testosterone levels in the serum and brain decrease. These results are consistent with the previous results demonstrating that the gut microbiota can in.uence the levels of some steroid hormones by shifting the ra-tio of active and inactive steroid levels through degradation path-ways (Needham 
et 
al., 
2020). 
Our study identi.ed a type of depression caused by testos-terone-degrading bacteria in the gut, causing a decrease in testosterone levels and depressive symptoms secondary to clinical hypogonadism. Notably, our results show only a partic-ular niche of depression linked to low testosterone levels, rather than all those meeting the clinical cutoff for hypogonadism. A previous review indicates that for depressive symptoms sec-ondary to clinical hypogonadism, there are strong evidences for the ef.cacy of testosterone replacement therapy; for sub-threshold depressive symptoms in men without clinical hypogo-nadism, there is preliminary evidence for the ef.cacy of testos-terone augmentation; and for treatment-resistant MDD in men without clinical hypogonadism, there are strong evidences for there being no bene.t to testosterone augmentation (Dwyer 
et 
al., 
2020). Our result demonstrated that testosterone supple-mentation is effective in alleviating depression-like behaviors in rats, which reinforced the previous conclusion. Future studies can compare the effect of testosterone supplementation in pa-tients with testosterone-degrading bacterial infection with other patients exhibiting depressive symptoms secondary to clinical hypogonadism. Determining the effect of using antibiotics to clear bacteria in this patient population will provide further insights. 
Many studies have shown that Actinomycetes are more abun-dant in the gut of the patients with depression than in that of the control subjects (Jiang 
et 
al., 
2015; Naseribafrouei 
et 
al., 
2014; Sharon 
et 
al., 
2016; Zheng 
et 
al., 
2016). However, it is not clear how Actinomycetes are associated with depression. In fact, Actinomycetes can metabolize steroids (Holert 
et 
al., 
2018). Therefore, many bacteria in the Actinomycetes family may degrade testosterone. We speculated that Actinomycetes may reduce the testosterone levels of serum and brain through the degradation of testosterone, resulting in depression. 
However, there remain several unaddressed questions. First, our results showed that the distribution of 3b-HSD was more common than that of M. neoaurum in the depression group, indicating that M. neoaurum was not the only bacterium in the gut harboring 3b-HSD. Other testosterone-degrading bacteria were not evaluated in this study. Second, 3b-HSD was also de-tected in the gut of the non-depressed group, indicating that the investigation on whether 3b-HSD in the gut causes depression should consider other factors, such as enzyme activity, enzyme expression, enzyme inhibitors in the intestinal environment, and the production and regulation of serum testosterone in the host. The relationship between enzyme activity and the testosterone levels of serum and brain should be investigated in further studies. 
The discovery of relationships among testosterone de.ciency, gut microbial metabolism, and depression pathogenesis has extensive health-related implications. Our study revealeda mech-anism potentially associating the degradation of testosterone by

gut microbes harboring 3b-HSD with elevated depression risk. The role of the gut microbe in this mechanismsuggests modi.able risk factors for preventing testosterone de.ciency and/or depres-sive disorders. Further studies should focus on randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trials to explore effective interven-tions, such as antibiotic treatment, testosterone supplementa-tion, or 3b-HSD inhibitors, to prevent testosterone de.ciency or depressive disorders. 
Limitations of the study 
In this study, all rats were given short-term antibiotics before further experiment to deplete their gut microbiota. However, in the subsequent feeding for 4 weeks, the gut microbiota of rats may have slowly recovered to a different composition (Ni 
et 
al., 
2017); so the background gut microbiota (gut microbiota other than gavage bacteria) may be different, and we have not con-ducted an in-depth evaluation of the background gut-microbiota composition. However, we set up a control group in each batch of experiments to exclude the in.uence of the background gut microbiota on the experimental conclusions.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS 
Rats 
Animal studies were conducted in strict accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Experiment Center Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (approval no. S0271902190A). Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 6 weeks of age, n = 6¨C12 per group) were purchased from Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Corporation (Hunan, China) and reared in the speci.c pathogen-free (SPF) sector of the Animal Experiment Center of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and acclimatized for 1 week before being used for experiments. Rats were maintained under SPF conditions on a 12-h light/dark schedule in a humidity-and temperature-controlled (22¨C25 C) environ-ment with autoclaved standard chow and water. 
Human subjects 
All protocols were approved by the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University Institutional Review Board (approval no. WDRY2021-K041). Informed consent was waived by the committee. Participants were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. For the depression group, male volunteers (aged 18¨C65 years) meeting the Diagnostic Criteria for Depression from the DSM-V published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013 for major depressive disorders (such as MDD and dysthymic disorder) were eligible. Exclusion criteria included patients with active psychosis or dementia, those with both clear intent and suicidal ideation, those meeting criteria for substance dependence, and those with comorbidities that could affect testosterone level, including endocrine disorders and kidney diseases (Egede 
et 
al., 
2015). Finally, 107 patients with depression were included in our study. Serum samples were obtained from 77 of the 107 patients with depression. 
Age-matched non-depression controls (n = 102) were also included in the current study, recruited from volunteers who visited Re-nmin Hospital of Wuhan University for their annual physical examination and who did not meet the DSM-V criteria for MDD. As con-trols, all clinical indices were within normal ranges, including chest X-ray, urine and feces evaluations, routine examination of blood, physical examination, and preoperative serological tests (kidney and liver function tests).

Detection of serum and brain testosterone 
Blood samples of rats were collected from the inferior vena cava after inhaling anesthesia. Blood samples of human were collected via elbow venous blood. For serum (100 mL) from humans or rats, samples were added into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes spiked with the testosterone internal standard (2 mL). The whole brain tissue was mashed, and 0.25 g of the brain homogenate was collected in 
1.5 mL centrifuge tubes spiked with the testosterone internal standard (2 mL). Next, methyl tert-butyl ether (500 mL) was added for extraction. Then the upper organic phase was transferred into a new tube and was evaporated using nitrogen (60 C, 5 min), and

redissolved using 50% methanol. The testosterone was analyzed using an Ekspert ultraLC 100-XL system (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) coupled to an AB SCIEX 4500 QTRAP mass spectrometer with a 1.7 mm, 2.1 3 50 mm ACQUITY UPLC BEH Shield RP18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Methanol with 0.2% formic acid (A) and 0.2% formic acid aqueous solution (B) were used as the mobile phase at a .ow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Data were collected in positive-ion mode. 
Fecal sample collection 
Each participant provided a fresh fecal pellet sample between 06:00 and 09:00 AM during normal defecation. The samples were immediately stored in liquid nitrogen and used in the experiment or stored at -80 C immediately. 
Testosterone degradation by fecal microbiota 
Feces pellets (0.8¨C1.2 g) were collected from random six participants in depression group or non-depression group and suspended using 10 mL of normal saline in sterile tubes. After centrifugation at 2,000 3 g at 4 C for 1 min, bacteria-enriched supernatants were collected in sterile tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 3 g for 5 min. Then, the supernatant was discarded and the fecal microbiota of bacterial pellets was resuspended using 10 mL normal saline following addition of testosterone (2 g/L) in the sterile tubes. Then, 
0.5 mL of the suspension was harvested every 24 h. 
Gut microbiota collection 
According to a published fecal microbiota transplant method (Yuan 
et 
al., 
2019), fresh feces pellets (0.20¨C0.30 g) from participants were collected and suspended using 10 mL normal saline in sterile tubes. After centrifugation at 2,000 3 g at 4 C for 1 min, bacteria-enriched supernatants were collected in sterile tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 3 g for 5 min. Then, the supernatant was discarded and the fecal microbiota of bacterial pellets was resuspended using 10 mL normal saline. This microbial preparation was used for fecal microbiota transplant or stored at -80 C. According to the recommendations from transplantation protocols (Secombe 
et 
al., 
2021), the details for fecal microbiota transplant are listed in Table 
S1. 
Gavage with bacteria in rats 
Rats were treated with short-term antibiotic before gavage (Chevalier 
et 
al., 
2020). Brie.y, rats were given a cocktail comprising 
0.5 mg/mL vancomycin, 1 mg/mL neomycin, 1 mg/mL metronidazole, and 1 mg/mL ampicillin in their drinking water for 1 week to deplete intestinal microorganisms, followed by one-day autoclaved water (Miyauchi 
et 
al., 
2020). All antibiotics were obtained from Solarbio (Beijing, China). Rats receiving the bacteria were orally gavaged with 1 mL of microbiota solution or approximately 1 mL overnight cultures of bacteria (approximately 1 3 108 cfu once daily for three successive days) 
(Funabashi 
et 
al., 
2020). 
E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 and E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a were induced with isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; 
0.25 mM) before gavage. 
Gavage with testosterone or AD in rats 
For testosterone treatment, E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 recipients were treated with 0.5 mg testosterone daily for 28 days by gavage, beginning the day after E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 gavage. For AD treatment, ABX-treated rats (without any bacterial gavage) were supplemented with AD (0.5 mg/day for 28 days) by gavage. 
Behavioral assays 
Rats were subjected to splash tests, NSF tests, TSTs, and FSTs, in this order (Chevalier 
et 
al., 
2020). Behavioral assays were con-ducted within one week, with at least 24 h between each behavioral assay. All analyses were conducted with the experimenter blinded to the experimental conditions. 
Splash test 
Sucrose solution (10%) was squirted on the dorsal coat of the rat in its home cage. The sucrose solution soils the rat fur because of its viscosity, and rats initiate grooming behavior. After splashing sucrose solution, the time spent grooming, the frequency of grooming, and latency to grooming were measured for 6 min as an index of motivational and self-care behavior. 
NSF 
After depriving food for 24 h, the rats were transferred into a novel white methacrylate box (100 cm 3 100 cm 3 40 cm) with the .oor covered in wooden bedding. A single food pellet was positioned on a piece of white .lter paper (10 cm in diameter), placed in the center of the container. The rat was positioned in one corner of the container, and the latent time to feed was recorded for 10 min. Feeding was de.ned as biting food, not touching or snif.ng. After the assay, the rats were placed immediately into their home cage, and the consumption of food during the subsequent 5-min period was recorded as a control of the feeding drive. 
TST 
By holding tails wrapped in an adhesive tape, rats were suspended approximately 40 cm above the .oor under dim light environment ( 40 lx). The total immobility time was recorded during a 5-min period.

FST 
Rats were transferred individually in glass cylinders (20 cm diameter) that were .lled to a depth of 40 cm with water (23¨C27 C) under dim light conditions ( 40 lx). The total immobility time was recorded during a 5-min period. 
Isolation of testosterone-degrading strains 
Fresh fecal samples (0.5 g) from the patient with depression, who provide feces for former fecal microbiota transplant (Table 
S1), were added into 250 mL Erlenmeyer .asks containing 50 mL of a selective medium comprising basic medium (pH 7.0) and 3 mg/L testos-terone. The basic medium composed of 19 mM NH4Cl, 9 mM NaCl, 22 mM KH2PO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2$2H2O, 48 mM Na2HPO4 and 2 mM MgSO4$7H2O(Yang 
et 
al., 
2011). Incubation was performed on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm at 37 C in the dark. Three days after in-cubation, 1 mL cell suspension was added into new 250 mL Erlenmeyer .asks containing 49 mL of the fresh selective medium. This process was repeated nine times over a 27-day period. The .nal culture suspension was inoculated onto nutrient-rich Columbia blood agar plates to obtain bacterial colonies. The strains were tested for their ability to degrade testosterone, and those that degraded testosterone were identi.ed by 16S rRNA sequencing and whole genome sequencing. 
Testosterone degradation by M. neoaurum 
Before testosterone degradation, testosterone (100 g/L) was dissolved in methanol. For testosterone fermentation (Sun 
et 
al., 
2019), 
M. neoaurum strains were incubated in 5 mL of the LB medium (10 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L tryptone and 5 g/L yeast extract, pH 7.0) and cultivated at 37 Cto anOD600 of 2.0¨C3.0. Then, 3 mL of this bacterial culture was added into 30 mL of a seed medium (2 g/L citric acid, 20 g/L glycerol, 1.65 g/L (NH4)2HPO4, 0.05 g/L ferric ammonium citrate, 0.5 g/L MgSO4$7H2O, 2.52 g/L KNO3, pH 7.5) and cultured at 37 CtoanOD600 of 3.0¨C4.0. Next, 3 mL cell suspension from the seed medium was added into 30 mL of the fermentation medium (3.5 g/L (NH4)2HPO4, 0.5 g/L K2HPO4, 0.5 g/L MgSO4$7H2O, 0.05 g/L ferric ammonium citrate, 10 g/L glucose, 2 g/L citric acid, pH 7.5) with a .nal testosterone concentration of 2 g/L. Then, 1 mL of the culture was harvested every 24 h and stored at -80 C until further analysis. 
TLC for steroids 
Stored samples (500 mL) were thawed in a 37 C water bath and were extracted with 500 mL ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, 2 mL supernatant were added to TLC plates (Qingdao Marine Chemical Factory, Qingdao, China). Ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (4:6, v/v) was used to observe the formation of products. Testosterone and its products were visualized using 20% sulfuric acid solution before baking (80 C, 30 min). 
Quanti.cation of steroids using HPLC 
Stored samples (500 mL) were thawed in a 37 C water bath and were extracted with 500 mL ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, su-pernatant was quanti.ed on a 3.9*150mm, 5 mm, 30 C Xterra RP-C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) using methanol/water (80:20, v/v) as the mobile phase on UtiMate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scienti.c, Waltham, MA, USA). The .ow rate was 0.8 mL/min. Testosterone and its products were detected with ultraviolet light at 254 nm. 
E-test 
The E-test was conducted using a kit (Autobio, Zhengzhou, China), according to the manufacturer¡¯s instructions. For anti-M. neo-aurum susceptibility testing, Columbia blood agar plates were inoculated with a sterile cotton swab dipped into the M. neoaurum inoculum suspension. After 37 C incubation for 48 h, MIC was the lowest drug concentration on the scale of the elliptical edge con-tact test paper. 
Whole genome sequencing of M. neoaurum 
The genomic DNA of M. neoaurum was extracted using Bacterial Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China), following the manufacturer¡¯s instructions. The whole genome sequencing was performed and assembled by GrandOmics (Wuhan, China) using T7 (MGI, shenzhen, China) and PromethION (Oxford nanopore, oxford, UK) platforms. 
Heterologous expression of 3b-HSD in E. coli 
Plasmid pET28a was used as an overexpression vector to express 3b-HSD from M. neoaurum in E. coli. Genomic DNA of 
M. neoaurum was used as a template to amplify a fragment of 3b-HSD via PCR (forward primer: 50-AATTCGGATCCTCAGCTCT TCGGTGCCGCG-30 , reverse primer: 50-CAGCCATATGGGTGACCCAACTTTGCGTAC-30), and the ampli.ed fragment was digested by BamHI and NdeI and cloned into the pET28a plasmid to construct the plasmid pDL01. The sequence of pDL01 was con.rmed via DNA sequencing. The correct plasmid pDL01 was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to construct E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01, and the vector pET28a was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) to construct E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a as a control. E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pDL01 or E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET28a were incubated in 30 mL of the LB medium at 37 C on a rotary shaker at 220 rpm. When the OD600 reached 0.8¨C1.2, 0.5 mM IPTG was added into the medium to induce 3b-HSD expression.

Analysis of the kinetic parameters of 3b-HSD 
Based on a previous method (Liu 
et 
al., 
2020), recombinant 3b-HSD protein was puri.ed from intracellular proteins through sonication and Ni-af.nity chromatography. Brie.y, after overexpression cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 3 g for20minat4 Cand resuspended in buffer A (20 mmol L 1 Tris, pH 7.6, 500 mmol L 1 NaCl, 10% glycerol). The cell suspension was lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 25000 3 g for 1 h at 4 C. The Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA, USA) was charged and washed with two column volumes (CV) of buffer A, and the .ltered supernatant was applied to the column. The resin was washed with two CV each of buffers containing 0, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mmol L 1 imidazole. The puri.ed protein was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal .lter devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and the buffer was replaced with storage buffer (100 mmol L 1 phos-phate buffer, 10% glycerol, pH 7.6) via the PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). Then, the puri.ed protein was detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). 
Kinetic parameters for 3b-HSD from M. neoaurum were determined in assays containing 200 mM NAD+, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and 5 mM3b-HSD. The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 C. Substrate testosterone concentrations varied from 1 to 50 mM, and a 20 mL sample was pipetted and mixed with an equal volume of acetonitrile to stop the reaction. Product formation was determined using HPLC, as described above. Reactions were performed in triplicate, and data were .tted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the least-squares method. 
Western blot 
Stored feces samples (0.20¨C0.30 g) were thawed in a 37 C water bath then suspended in 10 mL normal saline in sterile tubes. After centrifugation at 2,000 3 g at 4 C for 1 min, bacteria-enriched supernatants were collected in sterile tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 3 g for 5 min. After discarding the supernatant, fecal microbiota was treated with 250 mL RIPA lysis buffer (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) followed by sonication and centrifugation at 12,000 3 g for 5 min. Then, 30 mg of protein was loaded in 8% separating gel and 5% concentrated gel for electrophoresis and blotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Shanghai, China). Membranes were blocked in 5% skimmed milk and incubated with primary antibodies for His-Tag (Abbkine Scienti.c, Wuhan, China). Finally, membranes were developed using ECL kit (Bio-Rad, Shanghai, China) and captured using QuickChemi Imager (QuickChemi 5100, Monna, Jiangsu, China). 
Fecal sample DNA/RNA extraction 
DNA was extracted from 0.25 g feces samples using a QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), following the man-ufacturer¡¯s instructions. RNA was extracted from 0.25 g feces samples using fecal RNA extraction kit (Bioteke, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer¡¯s instructions. The extracted RNA was transcripted into DNA using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthe-sis Kit (Thermo Fisher, Shanghai, China) for qPCR. 
qPCR assay for prevalence of 3b-HSD and M. neoaurum 
The 3b-HSD-related gene sequences in the GenBank database were searched using protein-protein BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/blast/) with M. neoaurum 3b-HSD as a query. Multiple alignment of the 3b-HSD-related gene sequences was conducted us-ing BioEdit (version 7.2.5). Conserved regions were used to deduce a degenerate primer pair (forward primer: 50-CGGCCSAGYGGN ATCTGGGG-30 , reverse primer: 50-CGTCRTTGAYGAARTASGCCTG-30 , and probe: 50VIC-TSGAYAAYTCCTACGT-30MGB). 
For M. neoaurum-speci.c primers, we compared the complete genome of M. neoaurum in the NCBI database and our sequencing data of M. neoaurum MN2019 with all Mycobacterium and Mycolicibacterium sequences in the NCBI database and selected conserved and speci.c genes for M. neoaurum. The obtained sequences were compared with the existing species marker genes in metaphlan2 (Truong 
et 
al., 
2015), and we ensured the markers were not selected as marker genes for other species. In total, 129 marker genes were selected for analysis. Based on NCBI BLAST, the gene with the best speci.city was selected for designing speci.c primers. Finally, M. neoaurum fragments were ampli.ed using speci.c primers and probes (forward primer: 50-CTGACCAAT CACTACTACC-30 , reverse primer: 50-CCATGTACTGGTTCTTGG-30 , and probe 50ROX-AGTTGATCGACAGCACCTCCG-30MGB). 
The gene 3b-HSD and M. neoaurum fragments were ampli.ed using qPCR with speci.c primers and probes on a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The reaction system included 10 mL Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Shiga, Japan; cat. no. RR390Q), 1 mL forward and reverse primers (10 mM), 1 mL probe (10 mM), 2 mL fecal DNA, and 5 mLH2O. The PCR was performed at 95 C for 30 s; 40 cycles: 95 C for 20 s, 57 C for 20 s, and 72 C for 20 s. 
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Data were presented in the .gures as mean ¡À SEM. Differences among more than two groups were assessed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey¡¯s multiple comparisons tests. P values < 0.05 were considered signi.cant. Signi.cant differences emerging from the above tests are stated in the .gures by *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Notable non-signi.cant differences are stated in the .gures by NS. Correlation between serum testosterone and the Ct value of 3b-HSD RNA or DNA were assessed using correlation analysis. Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS.
