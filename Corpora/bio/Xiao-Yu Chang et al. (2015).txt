The impacts of climate change on forest community composition are still not well known.
Although directional trends in climate change and community composition change were reported in recent years, further quantitative analyses are urgently needed. Previous studies
focused on measuring population growth rates in a single time period, neglecting the development of the populations. Here we aimed to compose a method for calculating the community composition change, and to testify the impacts of climate change on community
composition change within a relatively short period (several decades) based on long-term
monitoring data from two plots—Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, China (DBR) and Barro
Colorado Island, Panama (BCI)—that are located in tropical and subtropical regions. We
proposed a relatively more concise index, Slnλ, which refers to an overall population
growth rate based on the dominant species in a community. The results indicated that the
population growth rate of a majority of populations has decreased over the past few decades. This decrease was mainly caused by population development. The increasing temperature had a positive effect on population growth rates and community change rates.
Our results promote understanding and explaining variations in population growth rates
and community composition rates, and are helpful to predict population dynamics and population responses to climate change.

Introduction
It has been widely predicted that global climate change will affect biodiversity [1–3], species
distribution and population growth [4–6]. Forests, as indispensable resources on Earth, have
tremendous ecological, economic, social, and aesthetic value. Tree species distribution and forest composition will undergo substantial shifts in the future [7–11]. Changes in forest community composition may exert impacts on net primary productivity and carbon storage [12, 13].
It is essential to determine how climate factors influence forest population growth and community composition [14].

Average population growth rates are usually expected to be stable, but patterns of variation
in population growth rates are different for different species. Variation in population growth
rates is related to species birth, growth, reproduction and death [8, 15–17]. A recent study considered forest population dynamics, particularly the rate at which forest distributions might
shift under climate change [6]. Change in a forest community is related to species-specific responses of the tree species in that community to climate change. In terms of population dynamics, dominant species respond differently to changing environmental conditions [18, 19],
thereby giving rise to a change in community composition. For instance, Feeley et al. (2007)
[20] found a widespread decrease in tree growth rates for species occurring in large forested dynamic plots at Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), and the changes in growth were significantly associated with regional climate changes. Not long after, the authors revealed that, in
this same plot, there have been consistent, directional changes in the tree species composition
towards a significantly greater representation of species with greater drought tolerance, which
was consistent with long-term climate change [21]. Declines of population growth rates were
found in other studies, and these declines were usually climate-correlated [22]. Furthermore,
traditional analyses usually assume that tree species composition or population growth rate is
constant and fail to capture the temporal dynamics of these factors, making it difficult to attribute the change to environmental conditions [20, 22]. Thus, quantifying the temporal growth
dynamics of population in the context of community change when the influences of climate
variations are of interest is necessary.
Tropical and subtropical forests are major biodiversity hotspots harbouring many species and
are recognised as important global carbon sinks and sources [18, 19, 23–25]. Long-term directional changes in the community composition of tropical forests have been reported recently, and
these changes have been attributed to climate change [21, 26]. Studies have analysed the effects of
climate change on the composition of various plant communities in many areas, including deserts
[27], grasslands [28]and lowland forests [29]. Actually, climate-driven impacts on long-term community changes are difficult to disentangle from changes driven by stand development [30]. Although, the causes underlying these changes, specifically the contribution of long-term climate
change vs. successional recovery from past disturbances, remain debated [21]. To increase the accuracy and reliability of the assessment, the community development process should be considered when one examines the effects of climate change on community composition change.
To understand the effects of temporal environmental changes on community composition,
it is important to identify the rates at which species have already responded to recent climate
change [31]. Studies have indicated that climate change influences community composition
[32, 33], but few quantified the influence of climate change on community composition
change. To better understand the dynamics of community composition in a changing world, it
is necessary to quantify community composition change rate.
Herein, we aimed first to compose a method for calculating the community composition
change rate and to examine the influence of climate factors on community composition change
using two long-term forest datasets (the observation data from DBR and BCI). Second, we aimed
to conduct a linear model to separate the impacts of climate factors and time factors on speciesspecific population growth rate and to testify the impacts of relatively faster climate change on
community composition change rate within a relatively short period (several decades).

Methods
Database
We employed two long-term datasets for use in our analysis. One is a dataset containing
30 years of data from DBR (Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, Guangdong province, China); the

other contains approximately 25 years of data from BCI (Barro Colorado Island, Panama).
DBR has a subtropical climate, and BCI has a tropical climate. Rare species were not included
in this study, because they are more sensitive to disturbance and the variations of their numbers are more stochastic.
The DBR (23°100 N, 112°350 E) has a monsoon climate and is located in a subtropical, moist
forest life zone. The annual mean temperature is 22.3°C and the annual mean rainfall is 1678
mm with a distinct seasonal pattern. Monthly average air temperature and precipitation,
representing DBR's climatic regime, were obtained from the Gaoyao weather station [34]. The
reserve is dominated by regional climax, evergreen broadleaf forest represented by the Cryptocarya community, which is dominated by Cryptocarya chinensis, Cryptocarya concinna and
Castanopsis chinensis. Abundance of the 3 dominant species in two communities was investigated 9 times from 1955 to 1985. One community was Cryptocarya community, which was at
the relatively stable stage; the other community was Pinus-Castanopsis-Schima community,
which was at a relatively early stage of succession. There were very few human activities in the
study area until 1980s and there was no big pest outbreak before 1985[35]. More than twelve
10×10 m2 quadrates were investigated in each of the communities. The average abundance
(number of individuals) of 3 species in 2 communities for every investigation was recorded
[36] (S1 Table). The climate data for monthly temperature and precipitation in DBR were provided by Guoyi Zhou (2012, pers. comm., 5 September).
The BCI plot (9°9'N, 79°51'W) covers an area of 50 ha; it was the first plot established by the
CTFS (Center for Tropical Forest Science) and is undoubtedly one of the best-studied forests
in the world [21]. The island receives an average of 2634 mm of rain per year, with a pronounced four-month dry season from mid-December through mid-April [37]. Daytime temperatures reach an average of 32°C, with night-time lows of approximately 23°C. This island
has 1500 ha of diverse, moist, lowland, tropical forest, and has been protected from human disturbance for 70 years [38]. Abundance data collected from 1981 to 2005 on the 50 ha plot were
obtained from the Center for Tropical Forest Science (http://www.ctfs.si.edu/) and monthly climate data were provided by Steven Paton (2012, pers. comm., 23 October). There were 319
species recorded for woody stems  10 mm diameter at breast height. Among these species,
only species with an average of at least 10 individuals per ha for 6 censuses were included in
our analysis because large percentage changes in abundance of rare species could be caused by
minor, chance events [39]. Consequently, we finalised a list of 77 species for analysis (S2
Table). The total abundance of 77 species accounted for 91 percent of the total individuals on
the plot.

Calculation of population growth rate
To quantify population growth, we calculated relative population growth rate as:
ln l ¼ lnðN2 =N1 Þ=ðt2  t1 Þ

ð1Þ

Where t2-t1 is the time interval between two investigations; N1 and N2 are the numbers of
individuals for a species in year t1 and t2. This is a common equation to calculate population
growth rate [40, 41] and this model structure has been used to calculate the change of cover
[27, 42]. We obtained 8 sequential intervals in DBR and 5 sequential intervals in BCI to estimate the species-specific population growth rate. Once the population growth rates were estimated, we determined the direction and rates of change in the parameters by calculating the
linear least-squares regression coefficient (β) of lnλ vs. time separately for each of the species.
For BCI, we also analysed the distribution of β to see the overall trend of population growth.

We also analysed the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the abundance of
each species to explore whether there is any influence of abundance on population growth rate.

Calculation of community composition change rate
Based on the population growth rate, lnλ, of each species in a community, we composed a
method to calculate the community composition change rate. The expression is as follows:
S ln l ¼

Here, Slnλ is the community composition change rate, expressed as the average of changes
in population growth rate for the dominant species in a community, S is the number of species
counted in the analysis and lnλi is the population growth rate of the ith species. The index Slnλ
is a combination of the changes in biodiversity and population dynamics and reflects the rate
of community change over a relatively short period. A larger Slnλ value indicates a greater
change in community composition.

Climatic factors in population growth and community composition
change
Two basic models (the unrestricted exponential growth model and the restricted logistic
growth model) are often used to simulate continuous population growth. Almost all populations undergo three phases: the increasing phase, the stabilising phase and the decreasing
phase, but neither of the two models is able to describe the population declining stage. The interaction of three fundamental processes—(i) competition for resources, (ii) the effect of body
size on resource use and (iii) the effect of plant density on growth and mortality—will affect
the development of plant populations [43]. Given enough time, every population will decline.
The limitation may come from the external environment or the self-limiting of a species. Although the logistic growth model has frequently been used in forest ecology, species replacement during forest development makes the population growth of the majority of species more
likely to resemble a Gaussian curve (Eq 3).
f ðtÞ ¼ Ae

In this equation, μ is the time when a species reaches its maximum abundance, σ is the time
distance between μ and its maximum growth rate, and A is an adjusting parameter. We
adopted both a logistic model and a Gaussian model to ﬁt population growth for single species
in each plot. We used the Akaike’s Information Criterion corrected for small sample size
(AICc) to compare the ﬁt results of the two models. Finally, we chose the Gaussian model as
the population growth model for our analysis because the Gaussian model was a better ﬁt than
the logistic model for most species (3:1) (S1 and S2 Figs, S3 Table). We adopted the Gaussian
model (Eq 3) to the model of population growth rate (Eq 1) and obtained the following model:
ln l ¼

If σ2 = -1 / (2B) and μ = -A/ (2B), we acquire a simple model structure of population growth
rate:
ln l ¼ A þ Bðt1 þ t2 Þ

Here, A and B are aggregate variables and theoretically can be determined by any factor that
affect population growth. The linearity of this model structure makes the modelling process
and the interpretation of each parameter more simple and accessible.
The annual mean temperature and precipitation adopted in our analysis are the most common and important climatic factors. It is very difficult to tell how climatic factors influence A
and B with current knowledge. Thus, we constructed several possible models and compared
their simulation results. We used two indices, Adjusted R-Squared and Akaike’s Information
Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc), to compare the fit results for six models. We
planned to use the simplest model with the best fit for exploring the effects of climate on population growth (S4–S6 Tables). Finally, we chose the following model to test the influence of
temperature and precipitation on population growth:
ln l  T þ P þ ðt1 þ t2 Þ

Here T is the annual average temperature and P is the annual precipitation. The time factor
here t1+t2 was derived by introducing Gaussian curve (Eq 3) to a common population growth
rate model (Eq 1) in Ecology. A bigger value of the index can imply a bigger time interval, a
more recent observation along a time sequence, or both. When one of them is fixed, the index
can be interpreted by the other time factor.
If species-specific population growth is influenced by climatic factors, the community composition will be indirectly affected as well. To examine how climate influences community
composition, we used linear regression analysis between the community composition change
rate, Slnλ, and 6 different climatic factors (Tavg-annual mean temperature, Tmax-maximum
temperature, Tmin-minimum temperature, Pavg-annual precipitation, Pmax-maximum precipitation and Pmin-minimum precipitation).

Results
Trends in air temperature and precipitation
In DBR, the annual average temperature and the precipitation increased during the observation
period (1955–1985) (Fig 1A and 1B), while in BCI, they showed different trends over time. In
BCI, the annual average temperature increased while the annual average precipitation decreased from 1981 to 2005 (Fig 1C and 1D). The rate of increasing temperature in BCI was
greater than that in DBR. When we compared the trend of annual average temperature at the
two sites across a similar period (1981–2005), we found that the annual average temperature of
both DBR and BCI showed a similar upward trend.

Population growth rate
Population growth rates declined over time for most species in both DBR and BCI (Fig 2). In
DBR, except for C. chinensis and C. concinna in community II (the Pinus-Castanopsis-Schima
community), the population growth rates of the other species in the two communities decreased over time (Fig 2A and 2B). We analysed the distribution of the change rates for population growth rate in BCI, and the results showed that the population growth rates for most
species (84.4%; 65 of 77 species) decreased (Figs 2C and 3A), with 27.7% of those species showing a significant decrease. Based on the 77 species in BCI, we carried out a correlation analysis
between the population growth rate (lnλ) and time (the median of each five-year interval) to
explore the relationship between the correlation coefficients and the abundances of species.
The results indicated that many species with higher abundance showed decreasing trends of
population growth rate (Fig 3B).

Temperature data were unavailable for a few months in the years 1983, 1986, 1987 and 1988 for BCI. There
are 5 intervals for community I of DBR (1955–1963, 1963–1967, 1967–1978, 1978–1982, and 1982–1985),
two intervals for community II of DBR (1978–1982 and 1982–1985) and 5 intervals for BCI (1981–1985,
1985–1990, 1990–1995, 1995–2000, and 2000–2005).

Species in the two communities on DBR responded differently to the time factor (t1+t2).
Population growth rate of the 3 species showed a negative response to time in community I,
while showing a positive response in community II (Fig 4). The annual precipitation had a positive effect on community I but had a negative effect on community II. The annual average
temperature had a positive effect on C. concinna in community I and on the 3 species in community II. For the 77 species in BCI, the population growth rate, lnλ, showed a negative response to the time factor (t1+t2) (87%, significant), a negative association with the annual
average precipitation (62.3%, significant) and a positive association with the annual average
temperature (85.7%, significant).

Community composition change rate
We calculated the community composition change rate, Slnλ, based on the census data and the
fitted data, separately. The fitted data were estimated based on the Eq 3. At first we calculated
Slnλs for every adjacent census. The results showed that the fitted value and the true value displayed approximately the same variations over time in BCI (Fig 5E), while the variations of the
fitted value and the true value for the two communities in DBR appeared to be different (Fig
5A and 5B). We noticed that the census intervals of DBR were very different, from 1 to 11
years for community I and 1 to 23 years in community II. So we combined some short intervals
and recalculated the values and found that the fitted value and the true value displayed approximately the same variations (Fig 5C and 5D). The results suggest that when the community

years, and points indicate the population growth rate, lnλ, per interval. Community I: Cryptocarya community;

composition change rate is used as an index to compare different communities or different census times for one community, the time intervals should be identical.
The linear regression analysis between climate factors and community composition change
rate, Slnλ, showed that climate factors had no significant effects on Slnλ except on the maximum and minimum temperature in DBR and the minimum temperature in BCI. The

maximum temperature had a positive effect on Slnλ, while the minimum temperature had a
positive effect in DBR but a negative effect in BCI. The overall trend seems to link increasing
temperature with increasing community composition change rate (5 in 6 regressions) (Fig 6).

Fig 4. A multivariate linear regression revealed the effects of climate and time factors on population
growth rate in DBR and BCI. The climate factors are annual mean precipitation (mm) and annual mean
temperature (°C) for each time interval. The time factor is t1+t2 (year), which is the sum of two observation
years. All 3 models in community I, the model of C. chinensis in community II of DBR, and the 77 models in
BCI are significant (P<0.05). Estimates and 95% confidence intervals of coefficients for three variables
are indicated.

Discussion
Impacts of climate change on population growth rate
Population growth rate is the unifying variable linking the various facets of population ecology.
It is the summary parameter of trends in population density or abundance [40]. For 3 species

in DBR and 77 species in BCI, the population growth rate, lnλ, is negatively correlated with
time for most species. This is consistent with previous studies [15, 21, 22, 44]. However, these
studies could not determine the underlying causes of a declining population growth rate over
time [15], or attributed this decline to environmental factors such as rainfall patterns [22] and
survival variation [15]. The present study, however, indicates that this decreasing trend of population growth rate may be mainly a consequence of community development. When we use
the exponential growth model, logistic growth model and Gaussian curve to simulate population growth, the population growth rate, lnλ, decreased over time except in the exponential
growth model, where lnλ is constant (Fig 7). In addition, our multiple regression analysis
showed that lnλ was negatively correlated with time for the majority of species (Fig 4). It can be
concluded that for most species in a community, a decreasing population growth rate is

inevitable. This is because the plant abundance and species richness will be close to the maximum environment carrying capacity with increasing population density and plant size. In the
present study, community I in DBR was a mature forest; community II was in an earlier stage
of succession than community I. The BCI forest was mature and relatively stable throughout
the study period [21]. In addition to species-specific properties, the stage of population development is important in determining how the population growth rate of one species will respond to climatic factors.
However, previous studies usually measured the population growth rate by focusing on one
time period and neglected to study the development of a population. Such neglect may affect
predicted results because population growth rates change, and usually decrease, over time. Recently, using a specific database extracted from collected literature, a synthesis study examined
how population growth rates varied within and among 50 plant species [15]. They found that
population growth rates could vary greatly from species to species even within the same genus.
However, population growth rates of different populations within the same species were similar, particularly if geographic distances among the populations were small and environmental
factors were similar. These results can be explained by the present study, which demonstrates
that the population growth rate of one species is not constant and is likely determined by the
stage of community development and population growth. Different species usually appear at
different stages of community development and have their own individual population growth
parameters, even if they belong to the same genus [15]. Consequently, population growth rates
vary greatly when species from different communities of different development stages are compared. Alternatively, nearby populations of the same species always belong to similar communities of nearly the same development stage. Therefore, populations with similar population
growth rates may be geographically closer to each other.
Variations in environmental factors have substantial effects on plant population dynamics
and are considered essential for realistic models of population dynamics [45, 46]. Temporal
variation in environmental factors is important to population dynamics in terms of both longterm trends and short-term fluctuations [47]. Experimental warming has consistently produced an increase in vascular plant growth across the Arctic [48]. A recent study assessed the
climate drivers of recent unfavourable silversword population dynamics and found that the declining population growth rates of silversword were associated with changing climatic conditions. Annual population growth rates were strongly tied to rainfall patterns [22]. A modelling
study of a steppe plant community from eastern Idaho, USA, found strong effects of climate on

the population growth in 2 of 3 target species. A 1% decrease in the previous year’s precipitation would lead to a 0.6% decrease in population growth for one species, and a 1% increase in
summer temperature would result in a 1.3% increase in population growth for the other species
[49].
Similarly, our study shows that an increasing annual mean temperature would increase population growth rates for the majority of species. However, a decreasing annual precipitation would
also increase population growth rate in both DBR and BCI. This conflicts with other studies.
One explanation is the persistent directional change in the flora toward an increased abundance
of drought-tolerant species, possibly due to increasing temperature and/or a past decrease in
rainfall, at least in BCI [21]. Another possible explanation is that during succession, as shade intolerant tree species gradually decline, the community tends to approach a climax that is dominated by mesophytic tree species [50], which might be favoured by less precipitation.

Impacts of climate change on community composition change rate
Altered population growth of dominant species could have profound effects on community
structure and ecosystem function [49]. Most previous studies on succession rate only considered the species composition change of a community [51–53], but did not take population dynamics into account. In fact, community change not only indicates the species composition
change but also implies a proportional change of each species relative to one another [54]. One
could not say a community is unchanged when no old species disappears and no new species
established over years because the community composition often changes with different proportions of each species. Therefore, using the index Slnλ is more precise for detecting the rate
of community change. Slnλ is determined by population growth rates of dominant species of a
community, which can be predicted by environmental and temporal factors. Thus, community
composition change rate, Slnλ, in a relatively short time period is predictable.
The community composition change rate, Slnλ, is determined by population growth rates of
all species in a community. Accordingly, it can be inferred that at the stages when vast species
replacement takes place, Slnλ should be very high. This new index can be very useful when we
want to compare the stability of different communities during a time period or different stages
of community changing process.
We used linear regression analysis to detect the relationship between climate and community change rate, Slnλ (Fig 6). Because species respond to climate individually, it is very difficult
to predict the collective response. Our results suggest that a positive relationship exists between
increasing temperature and increasing community change rate. Although decreasing precipitation has a positive effect on population growth rate for most populations, the overall effect on
the community composition change rate seems complicated in our study. As we know, changes
in precipitation can affect community composition by altering germination, seedling establishment, growth, and survival [55, 56]. In some studies, changes in the timing of rainfall have a
greater influence on community composition than the amount of rainfall [57]. Another experimental study found that drought and warming treatments slowed down secondary succession
in a Mediterranean climate, and indicated that future drier and warmer conditions may severely affect plant succession due to the existence of both abundance-dependent and species-specific responses [58]. For the BCI plot in our analysis, the impact of El Niño event in early 1983
caused immediate increases in tree mortality, and since then there has been a persistent directional change in the flora toward and increased abundance of drought-tolerant species[21].
These changes in composition were reflected by the community composition change rate Slnλ,
which was extremely high in the 1980~1985 interval (Fig 5E).

From a long-term perspective, range shifts due to global warming will alter the structure
and composition of communities and change the function of ecosystems [59]. As different species respond to climate change in various ways, species previously regarded as aliens will begin
to appear in new communities. Species that can quickly adapt to new environmental conditions
will outpace those that cannot [60]. Studies in Siberia revealed that a warmer climate will likely
convert deciduous larch to evergreen conifer forests [61, 62]. When species diversity and abundance increase, community composition change rate generally will be accelerated. However, in
a relatively short time period of 20 to 30 decades, species composition will not change significantly. Although climate changes influence population growth of each species, these changes
will not fundamentally affect community change rate within a few decades.
To detect the community composition change rate over decades, we propose a relatively
more concise index, Slnλ, which refers to an overall population growth rate based on the dominant species in a community. The variation of Slnλ over time is mainly determined by community development. Climate factors can influence the population growth rate and accordingly
affect the community composition change rate. The present study indicates that increasing
temperature has a positive effect on population growth rate and community change rate. Decreasing precipitation has a positive effect on population growth, but shows a complex effect
on community change. As global warming will bring more precipitation to high latitudes in
both winter and summer and less precipitation to low latitudes [63], further study is needed to
reveal the relationships between the historical variations in climate and population dynamics
in broader areas.
