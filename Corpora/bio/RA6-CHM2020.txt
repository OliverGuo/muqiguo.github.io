Laboratory mice are maintained in artifcial conditions that potentially impact immunity. In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Yeung et al. (2020) demonstrate that mice released into a wild enclosure display increases in circulating granulocytes that are associated with an altered microbiota, notably expansion of fungi.

SUMMARY 
Free-living mammals, such as humans and wild mice, display heightened immune activation compared with ar-tifcially maintained laboratory mice. These differences are partially attributed to microbial exposure as labora-tory mice infected with pathogens exhibit immune profles more closely resembling that of free-living animals. Here, we examine how colonization by microorganisms within the natural environment contributes to immune system maturation by releasing inbred laboratory mice into an outdoor enclosure. In addition to enhancing dif-ferentiation of T cell populations previously associated with pathogen exposure, outdoor release increased circulatinggranulocytes.However,these＆＆rewilded＊＊ micewerenotinfectedbypathogenspreviouslyimplicated in immune activation. Rather, immune system changes were associated with altered microbiota composition with notable increases in intestinal fungi. Fungi isolated from rewilded mice were suffcient in increasing circu-lating granulocytes. These fndings establish a model to investigate how the natural environment impacts im-mune development and show that sustained fungal exposure impacts granulocyte numbers. 
INTRODUCTION 
The house mouse is the most prevalent mammalian model organism used in biomedical research and has enabled funda-mental advances in basic immunology. Yet, this ubiquitous model fails to recreate certain aspects of human immunity. Inbred laboratory mice and adult humans differ in the proportion of leukocyte subsets, transcriptional responses to microbial challenges, and other immune parameters (Masopust 
et 
al., 
2017; 
Tao 
and 
Reese, 
2017). Such differences may limit the pre-dictive value of experiments with mice when studying complex in.ammatory and infectious diseases, resulting in signi.cant shortcomings in translating laboratory observations to humans. 
Recent .ndings suggest that this shortcoming of the rodent model may be because of the speci.c-pathogen-free (SPF) envi-ronment in which they are maintained. Wild mice and pet store mice, both of which are exposed to a litany of pathogens that are typically excluded from SPF facilities, display an abundance of differentiatedmemoryT cells thatmorecloselyresembles thestate ofimmunityin 
adult 
humans(Abolins 
etal., 
2017; 
Beura 
etal.,2016; 
Choi 
et 
al., 
2019). Similarly, transferring embryos from lab mice into wild mice generates commensal-and pathogen-exposed offspring (wildlings) that more faithfully recreate human immunity than standard SPF mice, including the unresponsiveness to immu-notherapies that failed in clinical trials (Rosshart 
et 
al., 
2019). Sequentially infecting SPF mice with three viruses and a helminth shifts the gene expression pro.le of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) toward that of pet store mice and adult humans (Re-
ese 
et 
al., 
2016), further highlighting the role for pathogen experi-ence in normalizing the immune system. SPF mice are also distin-guished from free-living mammals by the lack of exposure to potentially immuno-stimulatory members of the microbiota that 
Cell Host & Microbe 27, 809每822, May 13, 2020 a 2020 Elsevier Inc. 809 



are absent in a laboratory animal facility. For example, the offspring of germ-free mice inoculated with ileocecal contents from wild mice display increased resistance to in.uenza infection and colo-rectal 
tumorigenesis 
(Rosshart 
et 
al., 
2017). However, the speci.c effect of the naturally acquired microbiota on immune develop-ment is unclear, and the non-bacterial members of the wild micro-biota, such as fungi, have not been examined in detail. 
We recently described a mesocosm system in which SPF mice are ＆＆rewilded＊＊ through controlled release into an outdoor enclo-sure facility (Leung 
et 
al., 
2018). In contrast to approaches that rely on catching wild mice, our experimental system allows us to control genetics and the timing of environmental exposure by releasing lab-bred mice into a natural environment. We can thus systematically compare genetically de.ned mice maintained outdoors with control mice of the same genotype kept in a con-ventional animal facility. Another key feature of the enclosure is that a zinced iron wall excludes predators and rodents harboring disease-causing infectious agents, while allowing exposure to natural soil, vegetation, and weather. Mice rewilded through transient release into the enclosure acquire a bacterial microbiota characterized by increased diversity and display heightened susceptibility to helminth infection (Leung 
et 
al., 
2018). 
In a companion manuscript 
(Lin 
et 
al., 
2020), we describe deep immune pro.ling of rewilded mice to identify a series of changes that occur to the immune system upon exposure to the natural environment and apply computational analyses to infer the impact of genetic and environmental variables. Here, we tested the hy-pothesis that colonization by microorganisms present in the natu-ral environment contributes to the maturation of the immune sys-tem that occurs in free-living mammals. We found that rewilded mice display an increase in central and effector T cells, similar to pet store mice infected with pathogens. We also identi.ed an addi-tional feature〞an increase in granulocyte populations in the blood and lymph node. These changes were not associated with path-ogeninfection but, instead,wereassociated withan altered gut mi-crobiota characterized by a substantial increase in fungi. Coloniza-tion of lab mice with the model fungus Candida albicans or fungi isolated from rewilded mice recreated the expansion of granulo-cytes. These .ndings implicate fungi and other members of the gut microbiota in the maturation of the immune system and sug-gest that differences between lab mice and humans are due, in part, to the lack of colonization by environmental microbes. 
RESULTS 
Rewilding Increases the Maturation of Lymphocytes 
To determine the consequences of microbial colonization and exposure to the natural environment on the steady-state immune system, we applied multicolor .ow cytometry to analyze the im-mune cell composition of blood and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) from SPF mice aged 6每8 weeks old at the time of release into the enclosure and captured 6每7 weeks later. Details of the cohort of rewilded mice are described in the STAR 
Methods 
and includes male and female wild-type (WT) C57BL6/J mice as well as an additional cohort of mice harboring mutations in in-.ammatory bowel disease (IBD) genes (Atg16L1 and Nod2) described in the companion study (Lin 
et 
al., 
2020). Matched control mice were maintained under SPF conditions in the insti-tutional vivarium, herein referred to as lab mice. The initial .ow

cytometry analyses were performed on all rewilded and lab mice because genotype did not affect the outcome (Lin 
et 
al., 
2020). We provide the detailed breakdown by Atg16L1 and Nod2 mutation status in subsequent analyses. 
In contrast to adult humans and pet store mice, SPF mice and human neonates lack differentiated memory CD8+ Tcells harboring CD44 and other markers of antigen experience (Beura 
et 
al., 
2016). We found that release into the outdoor enclosure led to the acquisition of these signatures of differentiation in T cells from the blood and MLNs. Compared with lab control mice, rewilded mice had CD8+ T cells with surface markers iden-tifying them as CD62LloCD44hi effector memory (TEM)and CD62LhiCD44hi central memory (TCM) populations as well as a corresponding decrease in CD62LhiCD44lo naive T cells (Figures 
1A and 1B). Similar increases in differentiated CD4+ Tcell populations were observed in rewilded mice (Figures 
S1Aand S1B). We also found an increase in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells ex-pressing activation markers KLRG1 and CD25, respectively 
(Fig-
ures 
1Cand S1C). Another striking feature of pet shop mice is the increase in mucosally distributed T cells compared with lab mice. Histological examination of the small intestine from rewilded mice revealed an increased number of CD8+ cells (Figure 
1D). Despite these features of enhanced immune activation, we did not detect in.ammatory lesions in intestinal sections (Figure 
1D). Thus, rewilding is associated with a general enhancement in T cell maturation resembling observations made in pet store mice. 
Rewilding Leads to an Increase in Granulocytes 
We complemented the above .ow cytometric and microscopic analyses of T cells by performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on MLNs from the same lab and rewilded mice described above. 112 genes were differentially regulated by >1.5-fold, the majority of which have known immune-related functions and were upregu-lated in the rewilded condition (Figure 
2A). Consistent with the aforementioned changes in T cells, pathway analyses indicated that release into an outdoor enclosure increased the expression of genes involved in lymphocyte signaling, differentiation, and migration. Other differentially regulated genes represented path-ways associated with polarization of myeloid cell types, such as IL-12 production and 
iNOS 
signaling 
(Figure 
2A). Wild mice have been shown to harbor changes in myeloid sub-populations (Abolins 
et 
al., 
2017). Therefore, we examined the .ow cytometry data for potential changes to non-lymphocyte cell types. We found a striking increase in the side scatter high (SSChi)fraction of PBMCs and cells harboring myeloid markers in rewilded mice compared with lab mice, indicating that release into the outdoor enclosure induced an enrichment in granulocytes (Figure 
2B). Similarly, we observed an increase in both the proportion and total numbers of neutrophils in the MLNs of rewilded mice (Fig-
ure 
2C). These .ndings indicate that rewilding leads to substantial changes in granulocyte numbers and identi.es expansion of this leukocyte subset as another key difference in addition to differen-tiated T cells between the immune system of lab mice and mice exposed to the natural environment.

antigens ex vivo. At the time of sacri.ce, we distributed single-cell suspensions of MLNs from rewilded and lab mice into 96-well plates pre-coated with a panel of UV-killed microbes (Figure 
3A) that are frequently found in the soil, surfaces of the human body, or both: Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, Bactroides vulgatus,and Staphylo-coccus aureus. We also included PBS as a negative control to establish baseline production of soluble factors and aCD3/CD28 beads as a positive control that non-speci.cally activates T cells. A multiplex bead array was used to quantify 13 cytokines and che-mokines in the supernatant following 48 h incubation. 
MLN cells derived from rewilded mice responded to microbial or T cell stimulation by secreting generally higher amounts of cytokines and chemokines compared with cells derived from lab mice (Figure 
3B). The exact cytokines that were over-produced were speci.c to the microbial stimulant, although some general trends include 2-to 10-fold increases in interleukin-17 (IL-17), CXCL1, CCL3, and IL-10. Ex vivo stimulation with the model fun-gus C. albicans, which frequently colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of humans, led to a particularly striking difference between cells from rewilded versus lab mice. These results suggest that im-mune cells of rewilded mice are in a hyperactivated state because of exposure to microbes, including fungi. 
Rewilded Mice Display Differential Colonization by Microbes 
Pet store mice and wild mice harbor a multitude of pathogens, some of which are lethal when transmitted to co-housed lab mice (Beura 
et 
al.,

that was not disrupted by prophage fSa3, which encodes im-mune modulatory proteins that are highly human speci.c, indi-cating that rewilded mice are likely colonized by an animal strain rather than a clinical isolate (McCarthy 
et 
al., 
2012; 
Price 
et 
al., 
2012)(Table 
S3). We found that a few of the mice within our SPF facility harbored S. aureus, suggesting that this bac-terium was already present in a subset of mice prior to release into the outdoor enclosure and was spread within the enclo-sure. Thus, the presence of S. aureus is not unique to the re-wilding conditions. 
The PCR panel also indicated that a subset of rewilded mice harbored other microbes that are frequently found in SPF facil-ities, such as Proteus and Klebsiella species that belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family of pathobionts (Table 
S2). We were able to isolate Enterobacteriaceae species including Citro-bacter koseri from stool of rewilded mice plated on MacConkey agar, which selects for Gram-negative bacilli from the gut. We inoculated mice with pooled Enterobacteriaceae species iso-lated from rewilded mice, and although we detected stable colonization, T cell and granulocyte population were un-changed (Figures 
S2A and S2B). These results are consistent with our observation that only a subset of rewilded mice were positive for this group of bacteria by PCR and indicate that Enterobacteriaceae species are unlikely to be suf.cient to mediate the changes to the immune system observed in re-wilded mice. However, it is possible that these and other types of bacteria work in concert as part of an altered microbiota community, which we examine below. 
16S rDNA sequencing of stool samples indicated that rewild-ing was associated with enrichment of Bacteroides and related taxa and a decrease in Firmicutes such as Lactobacillus and Faecalibaculum species (Figures 
4A每4D). These changes were modest when considering the previously reported large increase in Bacteroides abundance in the microbiota of wild mice compared with SPF mice (Rosshart 
et 
al., 
2017), likely re.ecting the fact that in our system, adult mice are released into the wild

environment with an intact microbiota. Although we did not detect a change in the number of taxa represented in rewilded mice compared with lab mice (Figure 
4B), it is possible that the coding capacity of the microbiota is altered following release into the outdoor enclosure. Therefore, we performed shotgun sequencing on a subset of WT mice. Principle coordinate anal-ysis (PCA) indicated that the communities of microbes segregate by environment (lab versus wild) (Figure 
4E). 184 gene families were identi.ed as differentially regulated, many of which were attributed to the Parabacteroides genus and are associated with metabolic processes (Figure 
S3). Together with the 16S sequencing results, these .ndings indicate that the composition and gene content of the bacterial microbiota is different in lab and rewilded mice. 
Our experiments in which we quanti.ed cytokine production by antigen-stimulated MLN cells suggest that rewilding is associated with reactivity to fungi. We mined the shotgun sequencing reads for fungal genomes and found that samples from rewilded mice included sequences corresponding to fungal

taxa such as Candida (Figure 
S4). Quanti-.cation of fungal burden by qPCR of the conserved internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal RNA on the same samples as above indicated that rewilded mice harbor a signi.cant in-crease in intestinal colonization by fungi compared with lab mice (Figure 
4F). These .ndings raise the possibility that acquisition of fungi contribute to changes in immunity. Below, we analyze the effect of Atg16l1 and Nod2 mutations on im-
mune parameters, and subsequently examine the effect of introducing fungi into lab mice. 
Atg16L1 and Nod2 Mutations Are Associated with Signs of Disease but Do Not Affect Immune Cell Populations 
ATG16L1 and NOD2 are among the most highly investigated susceptibility genes for IBD, an in.ammatory disorder of the gut that is associated with alterations in the microbiota (Wlodar-
ska 
et 
al., 
2015). Inhibition of ATG16L1, which mediates the cellular degradative process of autophagy, leads to excess in-.ammasome activity and epithelial defects in models of intestinal in.ammation (Cadwell

et 
al., 
2011). Although NOD2 can function upstream of ATG16L1 to promote immunity against intracellular bacteria or antigen

Only a subset of mice in the enclosure displayed any sign of disease. Rewilded Atg16l1T316A homozygous (5 out of 24) and heterozygous mice (1 out of 27) presented with diarrhea, whereas none of the other genotypes of rewilded mice or lab mice showed watery stool. Interestingly, all the Atg16l1 mutant mice with diarrhea were collected during the second week of the capture (Figure 5A). Although diarrhea was not observed in Nod2/ mice at any point during the experiment, many of them failed to gain weight following release into the enclosure (Figure 5B).

To determine the extent to which the enhanced activation and maturation of the immune system were caused by changes in microbial exposure, germ-free mice were reconstituted with microbiota through inoculation with cecal contents from re-wilded and lab mice, and then blood and MLNs harvested from their offspring were analyzed by .ow cytometry. We chose three representative lab and rewilded WT mice (de.ned as within a standard deviation of the average number of blood granulocytes in the respective conditions) as donors of cecal contents. Mice harboring the microbiota of rewilded mice displayed an increase in granulocytes including neutrophils (Figures 
6A and 6B). However, this increase was modest compared with the rewilded mice that served as donors. 16S rDNA sequencing showed that the bacterial community structures were preserved in the offspring of the germ-free mice reconstituted with cecal contents (Figure 
S6A). In contrast, quanti.cation of total fungal burden indicated that the difference in fungal load within the microbiota of lab versus

rewilded mice was not maintained in the progeny of reconstituted mice (Fig-
ure 
6C). Therefore, it is possible that sus-tained exposure to a high fungal burden is necessary to recreate the full effect of rewilding. The modest increase in granu-locytes observed in reconstituted germ-


free mice could be because of remaining fungi, immunostimu-latory bacteria, or both. 
Intestinal colonization by commensal fungi (the gut myco-biota) can contribute to mammalian immunity and represents an understudied component of the microbiota (Chiaro 
et 
al., 
2017; 
Iliev 
et 
al., 
2012;

et

et 
al., 
2016). To circumvent the technical dif.culties with establishing prolonged fungal coloni-zation in lab mice, we used an established model in which 
C. albicans is introduced into antibiotics-treated mice (Fig-
ure 
S6B). Although not a natural colonizer of the mouse gastrointestinal tract, C. albicans was an attractive model to initially test our hypothesis because we demonstrated that MLNs from rewilded mice are hyper-reactive to this fungus (Figure 
3). We found that antibiotics-treated mice inoculated with C. albicans displayed a substantial increase in granulo-cytes and neutrophils compared with similarly treated mice

receiving a control inoculum (Figure 
6D).Inaddition,increases in differentiated CD8+ T cell populations were observed in 
C. albicans colonized mice (Figure 
S6C). These immune cell composition changes were not due to systemic infection, as 
C. albicans colonization was restricted to the gut in this model (Figure 
6E). Inoculation of germ-free mice with C. albicans also reproduced the increase in granulocytes demonstrating that fungal colonization is suf.cient, though this approach led to a lower amount of C. albicans colonization and a correspond-ing, less dramatic change in granulocyte numbers (Figures 
6F and S6D). The degree of C. albicans colonization is compara-ble with the level we achieve upon inoculation with Enterobac-teriacceae (Figure 
S2A), suggesting a certain degree of spec-i.city for the microbial stimulant is involved in the increase in granulocytes. To further demonstrate that fungal burden directly in.uences granulocyte numbers, we treated 
C. albicans mono-associated mice with the antifungal drug .uconazole. Our results show that pharmacologically decreasing fungal burden rapidly leads to a further decrease in granulocytes (Figures 
6Fand S6E), indicating that the de-gree of intestinal colonization by fungi impacts the proportion of immune cells in the periphery. 
Fungi Isolated from Rewilded Mice Induce Granulocyte Expansion in Lab Mice 
C. albicans represents a useful model and is relevant to human disease, but its utility may be limited because it is unlikely to be representative of fungi acquired in the outdoor enclosure. Having determined that exposure to the natural environment leads to a large increase in fungal burden, we wished to compare the precise composition of the fungal microbiota of rewilded and lab mice. Fungal sequences represent a minor proportion of shotgun sequencing reads because of the dominant presence of bacteria. To address this issue, we performed ITS sequencing of stool to increase our resolution of fungal taxa. We found that the fungal microbiota of rewilded and lab mice segregated by PCA (Figures 
7A and S7A). In contrast to the bacterial micro-biota, we found that rewilding was associated with an increase in a-diversity of fungi detected (Figure 
7B). We observed in-creases in several fungal taxa, most notably an enrichment in Aspergillus species (Figures 
7C and 7D). Therefore, exposure to the natural environment leads to the acquisition of an altered and expanded fungal microbiota. 
Finally, we examined whether fungi acquired in the outdoor enclosure are capable of driving changes to granulocyte numbers that we observed in rewilded mice. We were able to isolate many of the fungi corresponding to the taxa identi.ed in the ITS sequencing reads when we plated stool from rewilded mice on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Figure 
7E) but were unable to grow any fungi from lab mice. We gavaged SPF mice every other day repeatedly for 2 weeks (Figure 
S7B) with a consortium of representative ＆＆wild＊＊ fungi consisting of Aspergillus candidus, Aspergillus proliferans, Chaetomium globosum, and Dichotomo-pilus Indicus〞corresponding to plates (i)每(vii), depicted in Fig-
ure 
7E. We found that these wild fungi were able to induce the increase in peripheral granulocytes and 
neutrophils 
(Figure 
7F). To test whether these fungi were suf.cient and to circumvent artifacts that may arise from repeated inoculations, we inocu-lated germ-free mice with the same consortium and found a 

Article 
similar increase in granulocytes and neutrophils (Figure 
7G). Together, these experiments show that fungi in the natural envi-ronment can contribute to the state of the immune system. 
DISCUSSION 
Recent studies have shown that infection with disease-causing pathogens that are excluded from SPF facilities lead to large-scale changes in immunity that can alter subsequent immune responses (Abolins 
et 
al., 
2017; 
Beura 
et 
al., 
2016; 
Reese 
et 
al., 
2016; 
Rosshart 
et 
al., 
2019). Exposure to these pathogens have been suggested to ＆＆correct＊＊ the immune system by increasing the number of mature immune cells to more closely resemble the state of the adult human immune system (Maso-
pust 
et 
al., 
2017; 
Tao 
and 
Reese, 
2017). These fundamentally important .ndings suggest that childhood infections that occur in most individuals contribute to the education and function of our immune system. However, the extent to which commensal or environmentally acquired agents are capable of driving these changes in immunity was unclear. 
We found that releasing laboratory mice into a natural environ-ment, even for a limited amount of time, can reproduce the enhanced differentiation of memory T cells previously attributed to infection by life-threatening pathogens (Beura 
et 
al., 
2016). ~25% of lab mice co-housed with pet store mice did not survive the procedure (Beura 
et 
al., 
2016), whereas 90% of mice released into our outdoor enclosure were recovered at the end of the 6每7 week period, with several of the stragglers success-fully trapped thereafter (all together, >95% recovery). Compre-hensive serology indicated that rewilded mice were not infected by the pathogens detected in pet store mice, although we acknowledge the possibility that agents not covered by the assay may be present, and that our rewilded mice were likely exposed to pathobionts that can cause disease in immunocom-promised mice, such as those included in the PCR panel. Consistent with the minimal infection by disease-causing patho-gens, visual inspection and handling of rewilded WT mice indi-cated that they were healthy and that their movements were sharper and muscles stronger than the lab control mice. Thus, our outdoor enclosure system may be useful for identifying immunomodulatory microbes that are dif.cult to isolate from wild or pet shop mice that have a more complex infectious history. We suggest that controlled release into nature can complement other approaches that expose mice to the natural environment and that each method has its strengths and weaknesses. 
The most striking effect of rewilding that we identi.ed was the expansion of granulocytes in the blood including neutrophils. This .nding is notable because granulocytes are abundant in hu-man blood and scarce in laboratory mice. Hence, we were eager to identify the environmental variables that drive granulocyte expansion. The microbiota of rewilded mice was characterized by a signi.cant increase in total fungi that included acquisition of Aspergillus species. The transfer of total microbiota including bacteria and fungi from rewilded mice into germ-free mice was able to reproduce the increase in granulocytes. Still, the propor-tion of blood granulocytes in reconstituted germ-free mice was lower than that of rewilded mice, potentially due to the poor engraftment of fungi. Therefore, we examined the contribution 

818 Cell Host & Microbe 27, 809每822, May 13, 2020 

Article 
of fungi directly and found that granulocytes expansion could be recreated through inoculation of lab mice with a model human commensal fungus, C. albicans, or a cocktail of fungi isolated from rewilded mice. Our observation that the degree of fungal burden recovered in stool correlates with neutrophil numbers provides additional evidence that fungi contribute to the propor-tion of granulocytes in the blood. Intestinal colonization by 
C. albicans occurs in the majority of adult humans and is associ-ated with enhanced T helper 17 (Th17) CD4+ T cell differentiation, and IL-17 produced by these T cells can explain the increase in neutrophils (Bacher 
et 
al., 
2019; 
Shao 
et 
al., 
2019). It is possible that the normalization of the immune system that occurs upon rewilding, at least with respect to granulocytes, mimics intestinal colonization by C. albicans in humans. 
Our results do not rule out a role for bacteria and other agents acquired in the wild. For instance, it is possible that an immuno-genic bacterial species was not successfully transferred to germ-free mice upon reconstitution, leading us to miss an impor-tant contribution of the bacterial microbiota. An intriguing and perhaps likely possibility is that bacteria and fungi conspire to mediate the full effect of rewilding. An important future direction would be to identify interactions between the fungi we isolated and the bacterial microbiota. Similarly, other environmental vari-ables may contribute to our observations in rewilded mice. In addition to initiating microbial exposure, eating vegetation and burrowing in the dirt could lead to continuous re-exposure or provide nutrients to the microbiota (Budischak 
et 
al., 
2018). A comprehensive pro.ling of microbes in the environment and dietary interventions in the lab environment are useful avenues to pursue. 
We also had an opportunity to determine the contribution of two IBD susceptibility genes. Neither Atg16l1 nor Nod2 mutation had a noticeable effect on the leukocyte populations we measured. Interestingly, Atg16l1 mutant mice that served as the lab controls displayed a large increase in fungal burden. Although unclear if related, a subset of the rewilded Atg16l1 mutant mice displayed diarrhea. We previously demonstrated that Atg16l1 and Nod2 mutant mice develop small intestinal de-fects in a manner dependent on speci.c commensal-like agents and that close relatives of these agents do not trigger any abnor-malities (Cadwell 
et 
al., 
2010; 
Kernbauer 
et 
al., 
2014; 
Matsu-
zawa-Ishimoto 
et 
al., 
2017; 
Ramanan 
et 
al., 
2016; 
Ramanan 
et 
al., 
2014). The observation that most of the Atg16l1 and Nod2 mutant mice did not display obvious signs of intestinal in.ammation may re.ect this speci.city of gene-microbe inter-actions in IBD. As we only included two genotypes and on one background (C57BL/6J) in this study, a more comprehensive ex-amination of genetic susceptibility to a change in environment is warranted. 
In conclusion, our results indicate that fungi are among the different infectious entities that mammals encounter in the natu-ral environment and represent one of the missing or altered com-ponents of the microbiota in lab mice kept under SPF conditions. Microbes, vegetation, and climate vary across the globe, and it is likely that exposure to nature has a different consequence de-pending on the location. Nevertheless, the recent study charac-terizing wildings noted that wild mice, when compared with lab mice, indeed display increased colonization by Ascomycota, the phylum that includes the Aspergillus species we found in our rewilded mice (Rosshart 
et 
al., 
2019). Therefore, exposure to fungi may not be unique to our experimental system, and it remains possible that this fungal exposure drives the altered im-munity observed in other studies examining wild or pet shop mice. When taken together, the .ndings we present here expand our understanding of the immunomodulatory role of intestinal microbes and indicate that a diverse fungal microbiota, likely together with the bacterial microbiota, participates in the differ-entiation of the immune system in a free-living mammal.

LEAD CONTACT AND MATERIALS AVAILABILITY 
Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be ful.lled by Lead Contact, Dr. Ken Cadwell (ken.cadwell@nyulangone.org). All unique/stable reagents generated in this study are available from the Lead Contact with a completed Materials Transfer Agreement. 
EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS 
Mice and Wild Enclosure 
All animal work was approved by NYU Langone IACUC (#IA16-0087 and #IA16-00864). All mouse lines were bred onsite in an MNV/ Helicobacter-free speci.c pathogen free (SPF) facility at NYU School of Medicine to generate littermates from multiple breeding pairs that were randomly assigned to either remain in the institutional vivarium (lab mice) or released into the outdoor enclosures (rewilded 
and Atg16l1T316A/T316A

mice) to control for the microbiota at the onset of the experiment. Nod2/ mice on the C57BL/6J background were previously described (Matsuzawa-Ishimoto 
et 
al., 
2017; 
Ramanan 
et 
al., 
2014). Atg16l1T316A/T316A mice, Atg16l1T316A/+ , and wild-type (WT) control mice were generated from Atg16l1T316A/+ breeder pairs, and Nod2/ mice were generated from Nod2/ breeder pairs. Additional C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and bred onsite to supplement WT controls for experiments. 16S microbial diversity at the conclusion of the experiment did not show appreciable differences in microbial composition within the lab populations (see companion manuscript Lin 
et 
al., 
2020; Figure 
S5). Outdoor enclosures were previously described (Budischak 
et 
al., 
2018; 
Leung 
et 
al., 
2018) and the protocols for releasing the laboratory mice into the outdoor enclosure facility were approved by Princeton IACUC (#1982-17). 
The enclosures consist of replicate outdoor pens, each measuring about 180 m2 and fenced by 1.5-m high, zinced iron walls that are buried >80 cm deep and topped with electrical fencing to keep out terrestrial predators. Aluminum pie plates are strung up to deter aerial predators. A (180 3 140 3 70 cm) straw-.lled shed is provided in each enclosure, along with two watering stations and a feeding station, so that the same mouse chow used in the laboratory (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20) was provided ad libitum to all mice. Mice outdoors, however, also had access to food sources found within the enclosures, including berries, seeds, and insects. 26-30 mice of mixed genotypes but the same sex were housed in each enclosure for 6-7 weeks. Longworth traps baited with chow were used to catch mice approximately 2 weeks and 4 weeks after release and again 6-7 weeks after release; for each trapping ses-sion, two baited traps were set per mouse per enclosure in the early evening, and all traps were checked within 12 h. For subsequent microbiome assessment, a fresh stool sample was collected directly from the caught mice, .ash frozen on dry ice, and stored at 80C until further analysis. Mice were weighed with a spring balance. 
, and 26 Atg16l1T316A/T316A laboratory mice (Total
30 WT, 29 Nod2/,31 Atg16l1T316A/+ = 116) were released into the outdoor enclosure. 19 WT, 19 Nod2/,20 Atg16l1T316A/+,22 Atg16l1T316A/T316A matched littermates (Total = 80) were maintained in the insti-tutional vivarium for comparison. For rewilded mice, traps were set regularly until the remaining mice were caught and were sampled for fecal microbiota. 25 WT, 28 Nod2/,27 Atg16l1T316A/+ , and 24 Atg16l1T316A/T316A rewilded mice (Total = 104) were caught in the .nal trapping for terminal analyses. All lab control mice were recovered. Euthanasia was performed by CO2 asphyxiation, and blood, MLNs, and intestinal tissue were harvested. Two Atg16l1T316A/+ rewilded mice failed quality control and were not included in down-stream analyses. One Atg16l1T316A/+ lab mouse was not appropriately processed and excluded in the .nal meta data table (Table 
S2; N = 79 in lab mice and N = 102 in rewilded mice). 
6-10 week old C57BL/6J mice of both genders bred onsite in a manner similar to the rewilding experiments were used for microbial inoculation experiments performed under conventional laboratory settings. 
METHOD DETAILS 
Flow Cytometry Analysis 
At harvesting, MLNs were removed and the single-cell suspensions were prepared in FACS buffer (HBSS containing 1% BSA, 1mM EDTA, 20mM HEPES, and 1mM sodium pyruvate). The whole blood were also collected in a heparin containing tube and after centri-fuging at 2000 rpm for 5 min, the designated plasma from supernatant was removed and stored at 80C until all samples were

collected and analyzed together. After two rounds of red blood cell lysis with 1x RBC lysis buffer for 5 min and wash with FACS buffer, the single-cell suspensions of whole blood cells were ready for the following staining procedure. MLN and whole blood cells were stained for live/dead with blue reactive dye and cell surface markers were labeled with the following antibody panels: Lymphoid panel: CD49b Paci.c Blue, CD11b Paci.c Blue, CD11c Paci.c Blue, CXCR3 Brilliant Violet 421, CD27 Brilliant Violet 510, KLRG1 Brilliant Violet 605, CD3 Brilliant Violet 786, CD127 Brilliant Violet 711, PD1 PerCP/Cy5.5, CD4 APC/Cy7, CD19 PE/Dazzle594, CD8 Brilliant Violet 650, CD43 Alexa Fluor 488, CD62L APC, CD44 PE, CD69 Alexa Fluor 700, CD45 Buv395, CD25 PE/Cy7.

FACS analyses were performed in a ZE5 cell analyzer (BIO-RAD) and recorded FACS data were analyzed by Flowjo v10.4.2. 
MLN Cell Stimulation and Cytokine Pro.ling 
Single cell suspension of MLN cells were reconstituted in complete RPMI at 2 3 106 cells/mL, and 0.1 mL was cultured in 96-well microtiter plates that contained 107 cf.u/mL UV-killed microbes, 105 aCD3/CD28 beads, or PBS control. Overnight microbial cultures were reconstituted at 108 cf.u/mL prior to irradiation. The stimulated microbes are as following: Staphylococcus aureus (Maurer 
et 
al., 
2015), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) (kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Darwin, NYU) (Srivastava 
et 
al., 
2018), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), Clostridium perfringens (NCTC 10240), Bacteroides vulgatus (ATCC 8482), and Candida albicans (UC820, kindly provided by Dr. Stefan Feske, NYU). Supernatants were collected after 2 days and stored at 80C. Concentrations of IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL1, IFN-g, and TNF-a in supernatants were measured using a custom mouse LEGENDplex assay (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer＊s instructions. Plasma concentrations of IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, RANTES, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL10, TNFa, GM-CSF were measured using a second custom mouse LEGENDplex assay (Biolegend). For each mouse pro.led for cytokine production in response to microbial stimuli a PBS control was also sampled. In order to normalize per mouse cytokine production, we calculated the fold change of each cytokine measure to the PBS control. There was no overall difference in baseline cytokine production for any cytokine in response to PBS between lab and rewilded mice. 
16S Library Preparation and Sequencing 
DNA was isolated from stool samples using the NucleoSpin Soil Kit (Macherey-Nagel). Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was ampli.ed at the V4 region using primer pairs and paired-end amplicon sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq system as pre-viously described (Neil 
et 
al., 
2019). See Key 
Resources 
Table 
for full primer sequences. Sequencing reads were processed using the DADA2 pipeline in the QIIME2 software package. Taxonomic assignment was performed against the Silva v132 data-base. Alpha diversity analysis was done using observed OTUs. Differential abundance taxa were identi.ed using linear discrim-inant analysis effect size (LefSE) in different biological groups at a threshold linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score described in the legends (Segata 
et 
al., 
2011). 
Whole Shotgun Metagenomic Sequencing 
Shotgun metagenomics sequence data was analyzed from rewilded and lab mice for microbial abundance and gene family abun-dance pro.les as previously described (Devlin 
et 
al., 
2018). In brief, the sequencing data were processed through an analysis pipeline utilizing the Huttenhower Biobakery pipeline (McIver 
et 
al., 
2018), including FastQC, Kneaddata, MetaPhlAn (Truong 
et 
al., 
2015) and HUMAnN2 (Abubucker 
et 
al., 
2012) to obtain an annotated gene abundance matrix. In order to discern major differences between lab and rewilded mice we utilized the WHAM! (Devlin 
et 
al., 
2018) interactive analysis platform and subsequent statistical tests to uncover major gene family abundance differences and changes in microbial taxa. Differentially abundant gene families were evaluated by a fold change difference of 1.8 in either direction of lab versus rewilded mice and an adjusted p value of 0.05 from a t test. The abundance of these differentially signi.cant gene families was also used for principal component analysis. 
Pathogen Screen 
Randomly selected mice were screened for the presence of infectious agents using EZ-Spot Assessment Plus Multiplexed Fluoro-metric Immunoassay (MFIA) and PCR Infectious Agent Testing (PRIA) Surveillance Plus Panel (Charles River Laboratories). Dried blood, feces, and body swabs were collected according to submission guidelines. 
MLN Cell RNA Preparation and Sequencing 
Frozen samples of single cell suspensions from MLN of lab or rewilded mice were thaw to isolate RNA from approximately 106 cells by RNeasy Plus Mini Kit according to manufacturer＊s instructions. CEL-seq2 were performed to do RNA sequencing on samples with good RNA qualities (RNA integrity number S 5) 
Histology and Imaging 
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 10% neutral buffered formalin .xed, paraf.n-embedded small intestine and colon tissue. Sections were collected at 5-microns onto plus slides (Fisher Scienti.c, Cat # 22-042-924) and stored at room temperature prior to use. Unconjugated, rabbit anti-mouse CD 8a, T cell surface glycoprotein alpha chain, clone D4W2Z (Cell Signaling Cat# 98941 Lot# 1

Article 
RRID: unassigned) raised against synthetic peptide corresponding to residues surrounding Asp42 of mouse CD8a protein (Russell 
et 
al., 
2018) was used for immunohistochemistry. 
Transfer of Wild Microbiota 
Flash frozen cecal contents from rewilded mice were transferred by two consecutive daily oral gavage procedures into timed preg-nant germ-free mice as previously described (Rosshart 
et 
al., 
2017). Three representative lab and rewilded wildtype mice (de.ned as within a standard deviation of the average number of blood granulocytes in the respective conditions) served as donors of cecal contents. Each recipient germ-free dam received the same 0.1 to 0.15 mL suspension on day 14 and 15 of pregnancy. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed as described above. Flow cytometry analyses were performed on offspring of both gender 6-10 weeks of age. 
Wild Enterobacteriaceae Isolation 
Serial dilutions of cecal contents from rewilded or lab mice were plated on MacConkey Agar and incubated overnight at 37C. Col-onies grew from rewilded samples within 12每16 h but not lab samples. Colonies were chosen at random and were identi.ed by 16S rRNA sequencing. For inoculation into mice, unique species was cultured in LB broth at 37C for 16 h, pooled, and conventional mice were gavaged with 1.5 3 108 bacteria. Stool was collected after two weeks and bacterial burden was determined. 
Staphylococcus Aureus Isolation 
Fecal bacteria were quanti.ed by dilution plating on CHROMagar Staph aureus plates at 37C. Colonies were selected at random and genotyped by DNA sequence analysis of the protein A gene variable repeat region (spa typing) and a variety of additional DNA polymorphisms and the presence of pvl genes as previously described (Copin 
et 
al., 
2019). 
Fecal Fungi Quanti.cation by qPCR 
Fungal DNA was isolated from individual fecal pellets using the NucleoSpin Soil kit (Macherey-Nagel) as described in 16S library preparation. Quantitative PCR was performed using SybrGreen (Roche) on a Roche480II Lightcycler. See Key 
Resources 
Table 
for full primer sequences. Relative abundance of fungal-speci.c internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA was calculated using the DCT method and the values were converted as fold change from the average CT of control lab mice samples. 
ITS Library Preparation and Sequencing 
The fungal ITS2 region was targeted for ampli.cation and sequencing with primers that append barcodes and Illumina adapters, similar to those described by (Taylor 
et 
al., 
2016). See KeyResourcesTable 
for full primer sequences. Notably, this results in the Illumina read-one from the reverse (LSU) side of the ITS reference sequence and the read-two from the 5.8S side. The ITS2 region was ampli.ed and Illumina adapters appended by PCR in 25 mL volume with Q5 High-Fidelity 2X master mix (NEB, # M0492L). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95C for 2 min, followed by 32 cycles of 98Cfor 15 s, 52C for 20 s, 72C for 45 s, and a .nal 2 min extension at 72C. We performed triplicate PCR reactions for each sample, then combined triplicates and cleaned the PCR products with Axygen AxyPrep Mag PCR cleanup beads (Corning, #MAG-PCR-CL-50) using 1.8X volumes of beads diluted to 62.5% in water (v/v) to remove large primer-dimers. Cleaned products were quanti.ed then multiplexed at even abundances and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq in paired-end mode with 300 cycles each and a 5% PhiX library spike-in to provide increased base diversity. All sequences have been deposited at NCBI under the BioProject PRJNA559026. 
ITS Sequences Analysis 
Raw sequences were imported into QIIME2 and read-pairs were joined with the vsearch plugin requiring a minimum length of 300 nucleotides (a completely overlapping pair of reads). Joined reads were then quality .ltered and exported to reverse-complement reads 
with 
the 
fastx 
toolkit 
(http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) due to the orientation of our ITS2 primers. Joined, quality-.ltered and reverse-complemented reads were re-imported into QIIME2 to employ the ITSxpress plugin in order to trim primers and extract the ITS2 sub-region (Bengtsson-Palme 
et 
al., 
2013; 
Rivers 
et 
al., 
2018). ITS2 sub-region extracted sequences were then denoised with deblur and a trim-length of 150 against the UNITE fungal database reference sequences (version 7) (Amir 
et 
al., 
2017; 
Nilsson 
et 
al., 
2019). Finally, the UNITE database was used to train a naive Bayes classi.er and to assign fungal taxonomies in QIIME2 (Bokulich 
et 
al., 
2018). The community matrix was subsampled at a depth of 906 sequences per sample and Bray-Curtis distances and alpha diversity metrics (observed otus) were calculated within QIIME2. 
Candida albicans Inoculation 
The C. albicans laboratory strain SC5314 was purchased from the ATCC. Fungi were cultured in Sabouraud Dextrose media with chloramphenicol (25 mg/mL, Sigma) at 30C for 16 h. The culture then was washed and suspended in PBS. Antibiotic treated or germ-free mice were orally gavaged with 150 mLof C. albicans (107 fungal CFUs). Feces and organs were collected and analyzed after 4 weeks colonization. For depletion of colonized C. albicans, germ-free mice were supplemented with .uconazole (0.5 mg/mL) in drinking water for another 2 weeks. Feces and organs were collected accordingly for analysis.

Isolation of Wild Fungi 
Feces or ileocecal contents from re-wilded mice were resuspended in PBS and plated on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) with chlor-amphenicol (25 mg/mL, Sigma) at 25C for 3 days. Individual colonies were re-grown on SDA plates to acquire the pure strains. Fungal DNA then was extracted from each isolated strains and sequenced using the ITS primers described below to identify the fungal species. 
Wild Fungal Consortium Inoculation 
A wild fungi consortium consisting of A. candidus, 4 strains of A. proliferans, C. globosum and D. Indicus (corresponding to the fungi on plates (i)每(vii) from Figure 
7E was cultured on SDA for 5 days and further cultured in Sabouraud Dextrose broth at 25C for 2 days. Fungi were passed through a 19-gauge syringe needle several times to break down the mycelium prior to oral gavage into mice and mixed at equal ratios. SPF mice were orally gavaged with 150 mL of wild fungi consortium every other day for 2 weeks and germ-free mice were giving with 150 mL of wild fungi consortium at the .rst day of experiment. 
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Statistical parameters including the de.nition of central value and the exact number (n) of mice per group are annotated in the cor-responding .gure legend. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 8.21 for Mac (GraphPad) by using an un-paired two-tailed t test to evaluate differences between two groups. For statistical analysis of multiple groups, the one-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons test was applied. (* p value < 0.05; ** p value < 0.01; *** p value < 0.001; **** p value < 0.0001; ns, not statistically signi.cant)
