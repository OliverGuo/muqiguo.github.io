Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are known to increase plant tolerance to several abiotic
stresses, specifically those from dry and salty environments. In this study, we examined the endophyte
bacterial community of five plant species growing in the Thar desert of Pakistan. Among a total of 368
culturable isolates, 58 Bacillus strains were identified from which the 16 most divergent strains were
characterized for salt and heat stress resilience as well as antimicrobial and plant growth-promoting
(PGP) activities. When the 16 Bacillus strains were tested on the non-host plant Arabidopsis thaliana, B.
cereus PK6-15, B. subtilis PK5-26 and B. circulans PK3-109 significantly enhanced plant growth under
salt stress conditions, doubling fresh weight levels when compared to uninoculated plants. B. circulans
PK3-15 and PK3-109 did not promote plant growth under normal conditions, but increased plant
fresh weight by more than 50% when compared to uninoculated plants under salt stress conditions,
suggesting that these salt tolerant Bacillus strains exhibit PGP traits only in the presence of salt.
Our data indicate that the collection of 58 plant endophytic Bacillus strains represents an important
genomic resource to decipher plant growth promotion at the molecular level.
Plants are largely considered to be meta-organisms due to their dependence on plant-specific growth-promoting
bacterial communities1,2. This dependence is associated with bacteria that can: 1/increase plant nutrient uptake by
nitrogen fixation, phosphate and zinc solubilization and siderophore production, 2/produce phytohormones e.g.
indole-acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA), 3/suppress biotic stressors by production
of antimicrobial compounds against plant pathogenic bacteria or fungus, and 4/confer plant tolerance to abiotic
stresses such as drought, salinity and extreme temperatures3–8. These characteristics led to several attempts to
identify plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) that can improve crop growth and yield9–12. One possibility
is to use biofertilizers to replace or reduce the use of chemical fertilizers that require non-sustainable petroleum sources. Based on Mahdi et al.13, the demand for chemical fertilizers will exceed the supply by more than
7 million tons by 2020. This shortage of fossil fuels used to produce chemical fertilizers is expected to increase
the price of chemical fertilizers and consequently limit crop production worldwide and more so in developing
countries. Moreover, chemical fertilizers negatively impact the agro-ecosystem and the environment as nitrogen fertilizers are made from ammonia and their continuous application results in pollution of water through
leaching and emission of ammonia gas14. Also, phosphate fertilizers, that are imperative to crop production, have

limited efficacy as up to 80% of the applied phosphorous precipitates in the soil14,15. Conversely, using PGPB as a
biofertilizers, improve the availability of phosphorous and nutrient supplies to crops, improve soil structure and
promotes a healthy, fertile soil9–12.
As sessile organisms, plants are exposed to different abiotic stresses that frequently co-occur such as high
temperatures, drought and salinity16–18 and exerts devastating effect on crop production16,17. In this regard, at
present, ∼20% of total cultivated and 33% of irrigated agricultural lands are affected by salt stress18 and more than
50% of arable land is expected to be affected by both drought and salinity by 205019,20. Both of these stresses have
been shown to affect the water potential and turgor of plants, thereby resulting in a reduction of plant growth21,22.
Interestingly, abiotic stresses such as drought and high temperatures also influence the spread of pathogens
and insects23–25. Thus, products that curb the loss of crops caused by pathogens and diseases are of great interest.
In this regard, several studies focused on siderophore producing bacteria as an ecological solution to help plants
to tolerate both biotic and abiotic stresses. For example, pyoverdine siderophores produced by Pseudomonads
control wilt disease in potato caused by Fusarium oxysporum26, the inhibition of plant growth caused by
Gaeumannomyces graminis27, as well as the suppression of maize root diseases caused by Macrophomina phaseolina, F. moniliforme and F. graminearum28. Ruiz et al.29 also demonstrated that the plant disease suppressing Pseudomonas protegens strain survives in a toxic environment created by the metal chelating mycotoxin
Fusaric acid (produced by Fusarium strains) by producing metal scavenging siderophores including pyoverdine
and pyochelin. Butaite et al.30 recently demonstrated that non-producers of siderophores, with the appropriate
siderophore-receptors, can exploit foreign siderophores, while siderophore-producers that generate exclusive
siderophore types render iron acquisition inaccessible to competing strains that lack the appropriate receptor.
Several studies tried to identify appropriate biofertilizers focusing on bacteria belonging to Bacillus31–33,
Azospirillum34, Pseudomonas34, Rhizobium34, Ralstonia35, Burkholderia35, and Klebsiella35 genera that can alleviate
these stresses for several crops such as rice36,37, maize38,39, tomato40 and wheat41. Not all PGPB can be commercialized as their resilience to different environmental stresses are low. In contrast, PGPB belonging to the Bacillus
and Pseudomonas genera are suitable biofertilizers, as they can survive in diverse biotic and abiotic environments42–46. Moreover, Bacillus-based biofertilizers display high resilience to diverse environmental stresses due to
their spore-forming ability. They also produce metabolites that confer to Bacillus strains better biofertilizer qualities than the non-spore forming Pseudomonas strains47. Some examples of Bacillus-based biofertilizers include
Alinit48, Kodiak (Bacillus subtilis GB03)49, Quantum-400 (B. subtilis GB03), Rhizovital (B. amyloliquefaciens
FZB42)50,51, and YIB (Bacillus spp.)52. Currently, none of these commercialized biofertilizers confers tolerance to
crops against salt stress, or salt and drought stress simultaneously. These factors highlight the urgency for developing biofertilizers that can confer crop resilience to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. In addition, very few studies focused on the identification of desert plant endophytic Bacillus that can alleviate salt stress as biofertilizers.
In the present study, we examined the endophytic bacterial community in plants growing in the Thar desert of
Pakistan. We screened Bacillus endophytes for their ability to: 1/support plant growth, 2/fix nitrogen, solubilize
phosphate, 3/provide protection against biotic stresses, and 4/confer tolerance to salt stress. This search for potential Bacillus biofertilizers was performed as part of the DARWIN21 project (www.darwin21.org).

Results and Discussion

Isolation and characterization of root endophytes from diverse desert plant species.

We collected our samples from the Thar Desert region in Pakistan. Table S1 describes the characteristics of the sampling
site and chemical properties of the soil. Briefly, the sampling site had sandy nutrient-poor soil with less than 5%
water content and a pH of 7.31. The physicochemical properties and weather conditions were very comparable
with different desert regions in the Arabic peninsula53.
Bacteria were isolated from a total of five plant species: 1/two Zygophyllum simplex, 2/three Panicum antidotale,
3/two Tribulus terrestris and 4/one Euphorbium officinarum and Lasiurus scindicus plants. From surface-sterilized
roots, a total of 368 bacterial endophytes were isolated from the five plant species (Table S2). Based on 16S rRNA
gene sequences, a taxonomic affiliation of the bacterial isolates was assigned to 141 of the 368 isolates with 99%
16S rRNA gene sequence identity, however the rest of the isolates (227 isolates) were excluded from the current
analysis due to redundancy of the identification on the genius/species level or low sequence identity in database.
These 141 strains belong to four major phyla: Firmicutes (42 strains; 8 genera), Actinobacteria (51 isolates; 17
genera), Proteobacteria (43 strains; 24 genera) and Bacteroidetes (5 strains; 3 genera) (Fig. 1). Using only few
plant individuals (1–3 plants) per species may skew the bacterial diversity as there is no guarantee that the plants
used in this study reflect the general bacterial diversity found in the plant species at that location and larger sample sizes might affect this distribution (Fig. 2).
Most of the endophyte strains analyzed in the present work showed a dominance of Bacillus of the five plant
species from the Thar Desert: 17% of the 141 characterized strains belonged to Bacillus (Firmicutes) as the dominant taxon, followed by the Actinobacteria genus Microbacterium (12%). Moreover, only Bacillus endophytes
were isolated from all plant types (Fig. 2). Interestingly, a recent report by Eida et al.53, showed a similar pattern,
as Bacillus was found to be one of the most dominant genera in a number of desert plants. Bacillus was representing a 33% of the total bacteria isolated from E. granulata, 22% from T. terrestris, 5% in P. turgidum and 9% in Z.
simplex.53.
It is interesting to note that Koberl et al.54 showed that bacteria isolated from Adleya desert soil in Egypt were
similarly dominated by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, but the Firmicutes numbers were less than half that
of Actinobacteria. Marasco et al.55 further reported that bacteria isolated from the endosphere, rhizosphere, and
root-surrounding soil from desert farmed Capsicum annum L. plants (growing in the desert region in Egypt,
near El-Tawheed) were primarily Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, while non-cultivated arid soil harbored more
Actinobacteria (genus Cellulosimicrobium) and Firmicutes (genus Bacillus) than Proteobacteria. This result was
corroborated by Dai et al.56 in part, who reported the dominance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes endophytes in

Carragana microphylla growing in a plantation in the desert-region of Ningxia Hui, China. Several other studies
similarly reported the dominance of Firmicutes as endophytes in plants growing in desert or arid saline land57–59.
Taken together, the results from our study and the other endorhizosphere studies suggest that Firmicutes (especially the genus Bacillus) counts become relatively more abundant with host interaction.

16S rRNA gene sequences. The strains used in this screen are marked with an asterisk (*). P. typhae [LN867175]
was used as an out-group for the phylogenetic tree. Bacillus type strains used to construct the tree, include B.
subtilis [KY206830], B. subtilis [NR_104873], B. badius [KT382256], B. circulans [KR055041], B. endophyticus
[AF295302.1], B. megaterium [CP018874], B. cereus [CP023245], B. licheniformis [AY052767], B. mojavensis
[NR_112725], B. axarquiensis [DQ993671.1], B. halotolerans [NR_115063], B. tequilensis [NR_104919], and
Staphylococcus gallinarum [DQ350835]. Branches with support less than 50% were collapsed. Bootstrap values
are shown in the tree branches.

As Bacillus diversity at the species level was more pronounced than that for Microbacterium, we focused our
search for PGPB on the 58 isolates belonging to the Bacillus genus. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 58 isolates were used to construct a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3), which categorized the strains into 8 clusters. Strains from
each cluster were selected and tested for their ability to grow in liquid media. Some strains were unable to grow in
liquid media, thus only 16 strains were selected for further screening for plant growth-promoting (PGP) effects.

Identification of potential Bacillus PGPB.

Screening of Bacillus strains for common PGP traits. The
capacity to fix nitrogen, solubilize phosphate or produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) are key traits of PGPB10–12.
Zinc can also be a limiting factor in plant growth that can be improved by PGPB34,35. We therefore screened the 16
Bacillus strains for their ability to solubilize phosphorous (P) and zinc oxide (ZnO) or produce (IAA), and ammonia (Table 1). Among these, only B. subtilis PK5-26 and B. cereus PK6-15 could solubilize P and ZnO, respectively.
Also, B. badius PK3-68 and the B. circulans strains PK3-15, PK3-138 and PK3-109 were the only bacteria capable
of producing IAA. However, most of the strains (13 out of 16) were capable of producing ammonia. B. subtilis
PK5-26, B. cereus PK6-15 and B. badius PK3-68, that exhibited some of the other PGP traits (such as solubilizing
P and ZnO, and production of IAA), were amongst the strains capable of producing ammonia. Such PGP traits
have been reported for other B. cereus60,61, B. subtilis31–33 and B. circulans62 strains, but, to our knowledge, our
study is the first to report a B. badius strain with PGP traits. Studies related to zinc solubilizing bacteria (ZSB) are
less common63, even though this trait has been shown to positively facilitate plant growth. Nonetheless, the search
for ZSB is on the rise, and a zinc-solubilizing Bacillus strain recovered from soybean rhizosphere soil significantly
increased the Zn content in soybean seeds when compared with uninoculated controls64.
Screening of Bacillus strains for siderophore production. Several studies reported siderophore functions in scavenging of iron from the host or environment65, as well as in the biological control of pathogens, as several siderophores exhibit antimicrobial activity66,67. Thus, we also screened the 16 Bacillus strains for siderophore production
(Table 1). Only the B. subtilis strains PK3-9, PK1-2, PK1-3 and PK5-26 and B. tequilensis PK5-16 exhibited siderophore production. The siderophores produced by these and most other Bacillus strains have generally not been
screened for their antimicrobial effects. However, B. subtilis CAS15 was shown to produce the siderophore bacillibactin which significantly reduces the incidence of Fusarium wilt disease in pepper31. Since iron supplementation reduced this biocontrol effect, these results suggest that bacillibactin may be responsible for the biocontrol
effect31. Beyond this study, the reports by Butaite et al. (2017) and others26–30 (mentioned in the “Background”
section) suggest that iron scavenging and antimicrobial functions of siderophores are both shaping microbiome
diversity and community dynamics. Thus, siderophore producing strains such as the B. subtilis strains PK3-9,
PK1-2, PK1-3 and PK5-26 identified in this study, may be essential components of a biofertilizer consortium.
Screening for antimicrobial effects against selected known plant pathogens. Al-Amoudi et al.68,69 reported that
Firmicutes, and specifically strains from the genus Bacillus, are better targets for antimicrobial bioprospecting
than Actinobacteria due to the selection pressure in environments exposed to high salinity and hydrocarbon
contamination. For that reason, we further verified if these 16 Bacillus strains have antimicrobial effects that
might confer disease resistance to plants. Despite the fact that only five strains showed siderophore production
(the small sample size could affect this result), it is still possible that these Bacillus strains have antimicrobial activity via other mechanisms45,70–72. All strains were screened against the bacterial pathogen P. syringae that causes
bacterial speck disease73, and the fungal pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola that cause grey
mould74 and rot disease75, respectively. Most strains showed a potential as biocontrol agent except for B. subtilis
PK1-2, PK5-26 and PK5-68. Specifically, 12 of the 16 strains exhibited antimicrobial effects against A. brassicicola.
However, only B. circulans PK3-109 exhibited antimicrobial effects against P. syringae, while B. cereus PK6-15


Table 2. Bacillus strain resilience against abiotic stresses. Bacillus strains were evaluated for their resilience to
heat at multiple temperatures including 28 °C, 37 °C, 42 °C and 50 °C, as well as for their resilience to salinity and
at various salt concentrations including 0.5% NaCl, 1% NaCl, 1.5% NaCl, and 2% NaCl at 28 °C. (+) Indicates
growth and (−) no growth.
and B. circulans PK3-109 exhibited antimicrobial effects against B. cinerea. Thus, only B. subtilis PK3-9 exhibits
siderophore production and antimicrobial effects against A. brassicicola. Moreover, B. circulans PK3-109 and B.
cereus PK6-15 were the only strains that exhibit antimicrobial effects against two of the plant pathogens used in
this screening process. Also, B. subtilis PK1-3, PK5-52 and PK3-9, B. tequilensis PK3-2 and B. circulans PK3-15
and PK3-138 displayed the most effective clearing of A. brassicicola. However, this finding is not surprising as
B. subtilis isolate B776 and B. subtilis OTPB177 were reported to have antimicrobial effects against A. brassicicola.
Here too, it should be noted that the PGP traits are only representative of the 16 strains tested in this study, and do
not necessarily reflect the capabilities of the other Bacillus strains isolated in this study.
Bacillus strain tolerance towards abiotic stresses. The selected 16 strains were also evaluated for their resilience
against low (0.5 M NaCl), mild (1 M NaCl), high (1.5 M NaCl) and severe (2 M NaCl) salt stress conditions (see
Table 2). All 16 strains grew well on Luria-Bertani (LB) media and LB media + 0.5 M NaCl. However, B. tequilensis PK5-16 only grew under low salt stress conditions (0.5 M NaCl), while all other strains could grow under
high salt stress conditions (1.5 M NaCl). B. subtilis PK5-26, B. tequilensis PK3-2 and B. circulans PK5-39, were
the only isolates able to grow under severe salt stress conditions (2 M NaCl). With the exception of B. tequilensis
PK5-16, these results suggest that most of the bacteria are halophiles, growing best in media containing 0.5–2.5 M
NaCl78,79. This characteristic feature makes these bacteria ideal candidates for growing plants in saline areas or
upon saline irrigation. The next step is of course to test whether these bacteria can also interact beneficially with
crop plants in greenhouse experiments and finally in open agriculture.
Since the strains were isolated from the Thar desert, where large temperature differences occur between night
and day, the 16 strains were also screened for their thermotolerance (Table 2). All strains grew at 28 °C, 37 °C and
42 °C on LB media. The majority of strains were also able to grow at 50 °C, except B. badius PK3-68, B. circulans
PK3-15 and PK3-109 and B. cereus PK6-15. These data suggest that most of the strains may be simple/moderate
thermophiles, as they were able to grow under heat stress conditions up to 50 °C.
We shortlisted Bacillus strains for further assessment of their ability to confer salt-resilience to model plants.
For strain selection, we picked strains that are characterized with one or more PGP traits and with disease suppression capabilities. Bacillus strains with PGP traits and no antimicrobial activity were also included. The shortlisted strains were B. cereus PK6-15, B. badius PK3-68, B. circulans PK3-15, PK3-138, PK3-109, B. subtilis PK3-9,
PK1-2, PK1-3, PK5-26 and B. circulans PK5-39.

Testing Bacillus strains for their ability to enhance Arabidopsis salt stress tolerance. To test the

PGP potential of the Bacillus strains on plants, we inoculated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with strains showing
positive PGP traits and disease suppression capabilities. In Table S3, we list the strains based on their ability to
increase the fresh weight of A. thaliana compared to uninoculated control plants under salt stress conditions
(100 mM NaCl). Bacteria were categorized as plant growth-promoting bacteria (+)PGPB and/or salt tolerance
plant growth-promoting bacteria (+)ST-PGPB if they confer a statistically significant fresh weight increase to
A. thaliana when compared to the uninoculated control in the absence of NaCl and in the presence of NaCl,
respectively. A p value of ≤0.05 was used to determine the statistical significance and is indicated with an asterisk
in Table S3. B. subtilis PK5-26, B. cereus PK6-15, and B. circulans PK3-109 (not shown in Fig. 4) significantly
enhanced plant growth despite salt stress. When compared to uninoculated control plants, these strains doubled

Figure 4. Screening assay of A. thaliana inoculated with (A) Bacillus cereus PK6_15 and (B) Bacillus subtilis
PK5_26 in non-salt (1/2 MS, 12 days) and in salt (1/2 MS + 100 mM NaCl, 15 days) conditions. The total fresh
weight of Arabidopsis is presented as the mean of three biological experiments. Asterisks indicate statistical
differences compared to the control samples under the same conditions based on Mann-Whitney U Test

the fresh weight of A. thaliana under salt stress conditions (Fig. 4, Table S3). B. subtilis PK5-26 slightly increased
plant growth under non-salt stress conditions as well as under salt stress conditions. However, B. circulans PK5-39
and PK3-138 did not increase the growth of A. thaliana under non-salt or salt stress conditions despite their ability to produce ammonia and IAA, respectively. This result indicates that strains displaying PGP traits in vitro may
not necessarily function as PGPB in planta. Interestingly, B. circulans PK3-15 and PK3-109, B. cereus PK6-15 and
B. subtilis PK3-9 did not display growth under non-salt conditions, but increased the fresh weight of A. thaliana
by more than 50% when compared to the uninoculated control plants under salt stress conditions. These results
suggest that the presence of NaCl may be a trigger for these bacteria to induce factors that facilitate the growth of
A. thaliana under salt stress conditions.
At present, the nature of the growth stimulating bacterial factors is unknown. However, a recent
study described the desert plant Indigofera argentea endophyte Enterobacter sp. SA187, to produce
2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMBA) to facilitate salt stress tolerance via stimulating the ethylene signaling
pathway in Arabidopsis80. Moreover, SA187 was reported to increase the yield of the forage crop alfalfa when submitted to saline irrigations80, providing a proof of concept for the potential use of desert microbes in enhancing
the growth of crop plants.


Also, plants adopt different mechanisms to cope with the stress of toxic ions81. In Eida et al.82, we demonstrate
that five phylogenetically diverse bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of three different desert plants induced
salinity stress tolerance in A. thaliana through similar tissue-specific Na+ and K+ distribution patterns and transcriptional regulation of ion transporters. Currently, we do not know by which mechanisms the isolated Bacillus
strains render Arabidopsis salt tolerance and further studies at the transcriptome and metabolome level are necessary to define their mode of action.

Concluding Remarks.

Like similar studies, the results on the characterization and activity of the described
Bacillus isolates of this study are limited by the choice of the plants, sample size and the culture-dependent
approach. Nonetheless, this is the first work to identify a zinc-solubilizing B. cereus and to report the ability
of multiple Bacillus strains to promote/increase plant growth under salt stress conditions. Interestingly, several
Bacillus strains only showed an increase in plant growth in the presence of salt but not in the absence of salt stress.
These results suggest that salt stress might trigger the production of plant factors that ultimately stimulate yet
unknown bacterial factors to allow plant growth under salt stress conditions. Overall, in this work, we identified
several Bacillus strains that promote plant growth under ambient and/or salt stress conditions. This work further
provides the basis for a genetic evaluation of PGP traits in the context of optimizing agriculture of crops under
conditions of saline water irrigation. The combination of PGP traits together with the capability of the selected
Bacillus strains to enhance plant tolerance to salt stress makes them good candidates for sustainable agriculture.
To reach this aim, further evaluation of the PGPR quality of the selected Bacillus strains with a variety of crops
will be necessary under different culture conditions, including field tests on different soils and saline irrigation.
From the variety of the isolated Bacillus strains, we hope that some will turn out to protect crops under various
abiotic challenges and ensure crop productivity and yield for future generations.

Materials and Methods

Study site description.

Samples were collected from the Thar desert region in Pakistan
(24°45′00.4″69°56′00.8″E) at an altitude of 28 m. The selected location is characterized by low humidity, high
evaporation rates, high temperature and limited rainfall. The criteria of plant species collected was based on the
plants being indigenous species, perennials woody shrubs/sub-shrubs for easy access to the whole root system
and are growing in different desert region including the Arabian Peninsula. Samples consisted of three plant
individuals (PK3, PK3b, PK9) from P. antidotale, two plant individuals (PK5, PK7) from T. terrestris, two plant
individuals (PK1, PK6) from Z. simplex, and one plant individual from both E. officinarum (PK4) and L. scindicus
(PK8), collected in Zip plastic bags and kept at 4 °C (Bahauddin Zakariya University, Institute of Pure and Applied
Biology, Multan, Pakistan) before shipment to Saudi Arabia.

Soil analysis.

Three soil samples were collected from a site (24°45′00.4″N69°56′00.8″E) devoid of vegetation but in close proximity (approximately 2 m away from the vegetation) to the plant samples site. Each soil
sample was collected up to 20 cm of depth and placed in sterile tubes that were stored at 4 °C prior to processing. Triplicates of one gram of soil from each sample were used for soil analysis by drying thoroughly followed
by nitric acid (1 M) digestion as described in Alzubaidy et al.83. Element measurement was performed using
Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (Varian 720-ES ICP OES, Australia). Elements
measured include P, K, Ca, Cu, Mn, Pb, Na, Ni and S. The instrument settings were: power (KW) 1.2, plasma flow
(L/min) 1.65, auxiliary flow 1.5, nebulizer flow (L/min) 0.7, sample uptake delay (L/sec) 70, pump rate (rpm) 15
and rinse time (sec) 35. Carbon and Nitrogen were measured using Flash 2000 (Thermo Scientific) according to83.
pH was measured using the 5 Star pH Portable Meter (Thermo Scientific, USA). All the samples were measure
as three replicated with three to four technical measurement for each replicate. Three biological replicates were
measured for all samples.

Isolation and cultivation of endophytes.

As mentioned above, the samples consisted of three plant
individuals (PK3, PK3b, PK9) from P. antidotale, two plant individuals (PK5, PK7) from T. terrestris, two plant
individuals (PK1, PK6) from Z. simplex, and one plant individual from both E. officinarum (PK4) and L. scindicus
(PK8). Briefly, nine surface sterilized root systems from the nine plant individuals were used for the extraction of
endophytic bacteria. The bacterial endophytes were isolated using the standard cultivation-based technique. The
root systems from the nine plant individuals were surface sterilized by dipping in 70% ethanol for 30 s, then 2%
sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes, followed by washing with sterilized distilled water. The sterilized roots were
then macerated with 0.8% saline solution and subjected to serial dilution (10−2–10−5). Each dilution was spread in
duplicate on the different media (TSA, Tryptone-Yeast (TY), R2A, LB, and R2A with 1.5% NaCl) plates. In addition, 1.5% NaCl was added to R2A was used as a fifth media to enable the isolation of endophytes that can grow
in high salt concentrations. Not all colonies growing on the media plates were selected for isolation. Based on
colony morphology characteristic e.g. form, elevation, margin, surface, opacity and pigmentation, only bacterial
colonies were hand-picked and further purified. Single colonies were isolated from 10-4 and 10-5 dilution, in total
368 colonies were isolated; 118 from TSA, 37 from TY, 80 from R2A, 52 from LB, and 81 from R2A + 1.5% NaCl.

Taxonomical identification. Isolated strains were identified through the sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes.
Bacterial DNA was extracted using GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kits, following manufacturer’s instructions.
PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes was performed using the extracted genomic DNA as the template and the universal primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′-TACGGYTACCTTGTTAGCACTT-3′).
Thermocycler conditions started with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 seconds, annealing at 55 °C for 45 seconds and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 minutes, and a final polymerization extension
at 72 °C for 5 minutes. PCR amplification was verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and those showing positive

Phylogenetic analyses. In order to study the evolutionary history and taxonomical relationships among
isolated Bacillus species, the 16S rRNA gene sequences for 58 newly isolated strains were compared with those in
the GenBank database using NCBI BlastN. P. typhae [LN867175] was used as an out-group for the phylogenetic
tree. Bacillus type strains used to construct the tree, include B. subtilis [KY206830], B. subtilis [NR_104873], B.

The T-Coffee multiple sequence aligner version 1184 was used to align the 16S rRNA sequences using the parameter ‘t_coffee -mode
rcoffee’. Subsequently, to identify conserved blocks from the multiple sequence alignment (MSA), the Gblocks
0.91b85 was applied onto the MSA by using the minimum sequence for flank position at 85%, maximum contig
nonconserved position at 8, and minimum block length at 10. Next, we employ PhyML version 2012041286, a
widely used phylogeny tool based on maximum-likelihood principle. For building the phylogeny, the bootstrap
was set to SH-like branch supports, HKY8587 was used as the nucleotide-based model and parameter optimization was implemented for the tree topology, branch length and rate parameters. Finally the Newick output from
PhyML was used as input for the tree-drawing tool, TreeDyn 198.388 where all branches with branch support
values smaller than 50% were collapsed.
Literature search.

A literature search was conducted using PubMed49 and PubMed Central49 to determine
the number of articles that have assessed plant growth promotion through phosphate solubilization, zinc solubilization and indole-3-acetic acid production (see Table 3).

Screening the Bacillus strains for PGP traits.

For all biochemical assays, Bacillus isolate suspensions
were adjusted to an optical density (OD) of 1.0 at 600 nm, and 30 μl of suspension was used to inoculate all media
plates, unless otherwise stated. Also, all assays were performed in triplicate. In cases where the Bacillus isolates
produced high amounts of exopolysaccharides in LB broth, strains were alternatively grown in those media from
which they were originally isolated from (either TSA, TY, R2A, or R2A + salt).

Solubilization of phosphate and zinc oxide. Isolates were tested for their ability to solubilize phosphate (P) using
the Pikovskaya et al.89 protocol. Briefly, bacteria were grown on Pikovskya’s (PVK) Agar (M520, Himedia) plates
at 28 °C for 48 hours. Plates were observed for zone of clearance around the bacterial inoculum to identify bacteria
capable of solubilizing P.
Similarly, modified PVK Agar90 was used to screen isolates for their ability to solubilize zinc oxide (ZnO).
Here too, plates were observed for zone of clearance around the bacterial inoculum to identify bacteria capable
of solubilizing ZnO.
Production of indole acetic acid (IAA), ammonia (NH3) and siderophores. Production of IAA was assessed using
the Brick et al.91 protocol. Briefly, bacteria were grown in LBTD4 medium in L-Tryptophan (2.5 mM) for 48 hours.
Fully grown cultures were centrifuged at 10000 x g for 30 min. Subsequently, 1 ml of the supernatant was mixed
with two drops of orthophosphoric acid and 2 ml of the Salkowski reagent, then incubated at room temperature
for 30 min. Development of pink color indicates IAA production.
NH3 production was assessed using the Cappuccino and Sherman (1996)92 protocol. Briefly, 50 μl of bacterial
suspension was inoculated in 5 ml of peptone broth and incubated at 28 °C for 48–72 hours. Subsequently, 250
μl Nessler’s reagent was added to each tube. Development of brown- orange color was used as an indicator of
ammonia production.
Siderophore production was detected qualitatively using the Blue Agar CAS assay as described by Louden et al.93.
Formation of an orange-yellowish zone of clearance was used as an indicator of siderophore production.


Antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activity against plant pathogens (including P. syringae DC3000 and two
pathogenic fungal strains Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola) were detected using dual culture assay.
Briefly, the fungal strains were grown at 24 °C for 20–25 days on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plate. Fungal disks
were made using the back side of sterile 200μl pipette tips, and placed on new plates in one side and the selected
Bacillus isolates were streaked at one corner in other side. The plates were incubated at 28 °C and checked at 24 h,
48 h and 72 h for formation of cleared zone as an indicator of a potential biocontrol agent. For the antibacterial
assay, P. syringae DC3000 and Bacillus isolates suspensions were grown at 28 °C, 200 rpm, overnight on LB broth
adjusted to an optical density (OD) of 1.0 at 600 nm. The spread plate technique was used to inoculate LB agar
plates with 100 μl aliquots of each individual DC3000 culture, and then sterile disks were soaked with the Bacillus
suspension and added to each inoculated plate. Formation of a zone of clearance was used as an indicator of a
potential biocontrol agent.

Screening Bacillus strains for their tolerance against abiotic stresses.

Isolates were screened for
their resilience against heat and salt stress. In brief, the Bacillus isolate suspensions were grown in LB broth and
adjusted to an optical density (OD) of 1.0 at 600 nm, before being used to prepare serial dilutions (10−1–10−5). An
aliquot of 30 µL of each dilution suspension and the non-diluted suspension was used to inoculate each LB plate
used in the salt and heat stress tests. Bacillus isolates inoculated on LB agar plates were incubated at multiple temperatures 28 °C (control temperature), 37 °C, 42 °C and 50 °C) and incubated for 48 hours. These Bacillus isolates
suspensions were also inoculated on LB agar plates containing various salt concentrations (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and
2% NaCl) that were incubated at 28 °C.

Assessing the Bacillus strains on plant growth promotion.

The effect of inoculating Arabidopsis
thaliana Col-0 with each of the shortlisted strains (B. subtilis (PK5-26), B. cereus (PK6-15), B. badius (PK368), B. circulans (PK3-15; PK3-138; PK3-109), B. subtilis (PK3-9; PK1-2; PK1-3) and B. circulans (PK5-39)) was
evaluated. For this assessment, bacterial cultures were grown overnight in LB broth at 28 °C at 220 rpm. Culture
concentrations were then adjusted to an optical density (OD) of 0.2, 0.02 and 0.01 at 600 nm for each bacterial
strain. Bacterial cultures were then pelleted and washed with 1⁄2 MS media to remove all bacterial media from
the bacterial suspension. A final inoculum of 10 μl of washed bacterial suspension was inoculated to each of the
5-days-old seedlings. The control used for this method was non-inoculated seedlings.
Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 were surface sterilized, stratified on half-strength Murashige and Skoog
Basal Salt Mixture pH 5.8, 0.9% agar (½MS) (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) without sucrose media for 2 days and
then germinated for an additional 5 days at 22 °C, long day photoperiod (16 h light/8 h dark), 70 Lux. Germinated
seedlings were then transferred to fresh ½MS and ½MS + 100 mM NaCl and inoculated with 10 µl of individual
shortlisted strains (suspended in ½MS media adjusted to an optical density (OD) of 1.0 at 600 nm). Inoculated
seedlings were incubated at 22 °C, 16 h light/8 h dark, 70 Lux, for a total of 15 days post-inoculation. At least three
independent experiments corresponding to 36 plant seedlings were used for each strain analyzed. To clarify, six
seedlings per plate = one technical replicate. In total, three technical replicates were analyzed per treatment (18
seedlings for non-salt conditions and 18 seedlings for salt stress conditions). On day 9, lateral root density was
calculated using the standard calculation: The average number of lateral roots/cm of root length from 36 plants.
Fresh weight was measured for plants growing in ½ MS on day 12 and for those growing in ½MS + 100 mM NaCl
on day 15. The experiment was done in 3 biological replicates of 36 plants each for each treatment. Here it should
be noted that since, roots of plants grown on non-salt media already reached the bottom of the plates after 12
days, we harvested the plants at this time point. In contrast, plants grown under salt stress is slow growing and
hence were harvested at 15 days. It should be noted that we only compared salt to salt and non-salt to non-salt
treated Bacillus-inoculated plants to each other.
Statistical differences were determined using the Mann-Whitney U Test (https://www.socscistatistics.com/
tests/mannwhitney/Default2.aspx). For the comparison between non-salt controls and samples, and salt stressed
controls and samples, the means were used. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant (indicated with asterisks in Fig. 4). Note that in this study we opted for the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.
