Abstract: Combating the consequences of climate change is extremely important and critical in the
context of feeding the world’s population. Crop simulation models have been extensively studied
recently to investigate the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and food security.
Drought and salinity are major environmental stresses that cause changes in the physiological,
biochemical, and molecular processes in plants, resulting in significant crop productivity losses.
Excessive use of chemicals has become a severe threat to human health and the environment. The use
of beneficial microorganisms is an environmentally friendly method of increasing crop yield under
environmental stress conditions. These microbes enhance plant growth through various mechanisms
such as production of hormones, ACC deaminase, VOCs and EPS, and modulate hormone synthesis
and other metabolites in plants. This review aims to decipher the effect of plant growth promoting
bacteria (PGPB) on plant health under abiotic soil stresses associated with global climate change (viz.,
drought and salinity). The application of stress-resistant PGPB may not only help in the combating
the effects of abiotic stressors, but also lead to mitigation of climate change. More thorough molecular
level studies are needed in the future to assess their cumulative influence on plant development.

1. Introduction
Soil, as an extremely heterogeneous environment, contains many different microorganisms with different properties. Plant health and soil fertility require balance and proper
cooperation with beneficial microbes, especially bacteria [1]. In the natural environment,
bacteria may occur freely in bulk soil from where they can be transferred to the rhizosphere, or internal parts of plants as endophytes [2,3]. The phytomicrobiome is a whole,
well-structured community of all microorganisms in a given plant, associated with the
host [2–5]. The rhizosphere, a thin film of soil around the roots, is the primary location
of ion uptake for plants, simultaneously depositing nutrients and signaling molecules
into this zone [6,7]. This special mixture secreted by plant roots contains low-molecular
weight organic substances, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, fatty acids, organic acids,
vitamins and a small amount of secondary metabolites [8,9]. The extremely carbon-rich
root exudates create a unique space with maximum bacterial activity compared to the bulk
soil [7,10]. The nature of secreting exudates and various genetic regulations can influence
the structure of bacterial community in the soil [2]. This special recruitment of certain
microbes enables the achievement of tangible benefits that would not be possible during
solitary growth of the plant [11].
Climate change, despite its remarkable stability and repetition, is embedded in the
Earth’s past. However, human actions are significantly accelerating these changes in global
climate patterns [2,3]. The predominant signs of climate change are elevated mean surface

temperature, ice melting, sea level rise and extreme weather events [3,4]. As a result of
these rapid global alterations, crops are increasingly facing abiotic stresses, mainly drought,
salinity and heat stress [2,9,12,13]. The demand for food is constantly increasing due to
the growing population. Therefore, farmers have started using chemical pesticides and
fertilizers in high doses to increase agricultural production [9,13]. Altered soil properties
and structure due to climate change, along with artificial irrigation and unbalanced use of
chemicals, are leading to the destruction of microbial communities in arable soils [11,14].
Since 1961, a nine-fold increase in fertilizer consumption has been observed worldwide [14].
The negative impact on the diversity of bacteria in the wheat rhizosphere under inorganic
fertilizers has been established by Reid et al. [15]. According to model studies by OrtizBobea et al., anthropogenic climate change has significantly affected global agricultural
productivity [16]. The reduction in the amount of beneficial microorganisms and the
disruption of nutrient cycling in the ecosystem has led to reduction in yields of about
21% since 1961. Nowadays, most farmers still use inorganic fertilizers, which creates a
vicious cycle [16,17]. Additionally, the natural biocontrol properties of soil may become
severely limited under these conditions, exposing plants to various diseases. Similarly, the
host-pathogen relation may shift, as a result of global climate change [4].
Undoubtedly, the spread of land use nowadays is incomparably huge as opposed to
the past. Three-quarters of non-ice land, that is, about 17 Mkm2 , is actively utilized by
humans, of which around 13% is cultivated, and the value is constantly growing. It has been
estimated that since 1961 there has been a 3.5-fold increase of farmlands production and
2.5-fold increase of animal products [14]. As agriculture develops, the global food supply
is rising, along with the growing trend of meat and vegetable oil consumption [8,14,18].
Climate change is affecting the health of crops around the world [19,20]. This phenomenon is expected to worsen in the future, and there is a clear need to address this
situation. There is a large body of data in the literature on the effects of mitigation of abiotic
stress by selected bacteria [5,21–25]. In the present review, an attempt is made to study the
effects of using beneficial microorganisms, especially bacteria, on plant growth under major
abiotic stresses (salinity and drought). We intend to show that certain microorganisms
can help slow down these changes. In this literature review, various databases, such as
PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; accessed on 5 April 2021), EBSCO (https:
//www.ebsco.com/; accessed on 12 April 2021), SCOPUS (https://www.scopus.com/;
accessed on 3 May 2021) and Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/; accessed
on 7 May 2021), were searched for both quantitative and qualitative studies published
in the last 5 years. The following search terms were applied: “abiotic stress”, “climate
change”, “greenhouse gas emission” “pgpr” “drought”, “salinity” and their combinations
using AND as a function word. A total of 2325 potentially relevant papers integrated were
found, of which 220 were included in this review. Handsearching was also undertaken to
include scientific papers with different key terms.
2. Climate Change and Its Impact on Agriculture
Climate change is a consequence of numerous phenomena, including fluctuations in
solar radiation, shifts in earth’s movement in orbit, transformation of the atmosphere gasses
composition, switches of the surface properties of the soil and ocean oscillations [23,26].
The last two mechanisms are influenced by both human activities and natural factors. The
absence of global data and inability to assess the real impact of any given factor on climate
change leads to constant scientific discussions among researchers and policy makers.
Great emotions and controversies arise, above all, from the effects of climate change,
which affects not only the ecological system but also human life [19]. Agriculture, as a sector highly dependent on weather conditions, soil quality and irrigation, is most vulnerable
to climate change [27]. Droughts along with heat stress, floods, variability in rainfall and
extreme weather events caused by climate change have major impacts on global agriculture [14,19,28]. As immobile organisms, plants are forced to adapt to a particular habitat in
order to survive. Due to their adaptability in metabolism, physiology and development,

they can undergo limited changes in response to various abiotic stresses [23,26]. Unfortunately, the effect of a particular stress on a plant may reduce its tolerance to another abiotic
factor. This makes plants extremely sensitive [29]. Surprisingly, some plants under multiple
abiotic stresses may develop specified modifications as a multivariate tolerance response.
2.1. Global Warming
Global warming is defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
as the “rise in combined surface air and sea surface temperatures averaged throughout
the world and over a 30-year period.” [30]. It is also stated that human activities have
become the primary cause of change in the planet as it transitions from the relatively stable
Holocene to a new era known as the Anthropocene. According to the research, humaninduced global warming has reached about 1 ◦ C above pre-industrial levels. However,
in many regions a much higher temperature increase than the global average has been
observed. According to the projections, this value may increase up to 1.5 ◦ C or even 4.8 ◦ C
in 2100 [14,31]. Moreover, the warming over land is faster than the global average. The
mean temperature over land in the period 2006–2015 was 1.53 higher than in 1850–1900 [14].
Temperature is a key ecological factor with a direct impact on physiological processes
and plant development. An increase in temperature has a positive effect on faster development of green mass and a shorter duration of cultivation [32]. However, a sharp drop
or rise in temperature damages the plant cells, which ultimately leads in an overall lower
yield [32,33]. Zhao et al. have reported that yield losses in maize, wheat, rice and soybean
crops ranged from 3.1% to 7.4% per one degree Celsius increase in global mean temperature [32]. Other studies found a 6% and 4% decline in wheat and maize yields, respectively,
over a 29-year period of warming trends [34]. Heat stress due to increased temperature
is a limiting factor on photosynthesis, especially for C3 crops such as rice and wheat, but
also for C4 plants, maize and sugarcane crops [32,34–36]. In addition, temperature increase
affects plants through changes in humidity. Lowering the water vapor content in the air
leads to water loss from the plant, causing stomata to close and reducing the efficiency of
photosynthesis [37,38]. Prolonged high temperatures lead to drought and water stress in
plants, which in turn leads to water scarcity [38].
The change in global average temperature is not the only threat posed by global
warming to crops worldwide [39]. Other serious menaces are sea level rise, desertification,
altered precipitation and extreme weather events. Sea level rise leads to land loss and
salinization of freshwater due to water mixing. As the hydrological cycle intensifies with
global warming, exacerbation of unusual weather events, such as extreme precipitation,
flooding and heat waves, has been observed [17,40–42]. Global warming may also have
many unforeseen effects. Recent observations show that the melting of the ice sheet on
Greenland may become a source of highly toxic mercury pollution in Atlantic waters [43].
2.2. Greenhouse Gas Emission
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are components of the Earth’s troposphere, which can
retain solar energy, due to their physicochemical properties. The presence of these gaseous
constituents in the atmosphere retains an average temperature of 14 ◦ C, which allows plants
to grow freely in most lands. Their absence would leave the temperature around −19 ◦ C,
making life on Earth impossible. The major environmental sources of greenhouse gases
emission are forest fires, wetlands, oceans, permafrost, volcanoes and earthquakes [44].
They are usually naturally absorbed by the environment. However, the surplus caused
by human activity disturbs this balance [44]. The most prevalent GHGs produced by
anthropogenic processes are carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ) and nitrous oxide
(N2 O). It is estimated that it is the emission of these gases that contributes to over 90% of
anthropogenic climate warming. In addition, sulfur dioxide (SO2 ), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) are produced [45].
The intensification of global warming processes has been noted along with the increase
of GHG release [46]. The ever-growing human population has accelerated the demand for

energy, as a result of industrialization, urbanization and globalization [23,43]. Comparing
the CO2 content in the air before the industrial revolution with the present condition, it is
clearly shown that humans are the main contributors in the formation of this gas [23,43].
CO2 concentration is rapidly increasing, growing from 280 ppm in pre-industrial times to
400 ppm today. The forecast for year 2100 gives 540 ppm, and in the high emission scenario
even 940 ppm [28]. The increase in land use due to deforestation contributes to a quarter
of the increase in total CO2 emissions [14]. Fossil carbon, which has formed in the Earth’s
crust over millions of years, is released into the atmosphere as CO2 in enormous quantities,
over the course of decades [47].
In 2018–2019, GHG emissions in the United States of America and UE reached 6.5
and 4.4 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent, respectively [48,49]. During 2014, in the
list of the world’s topmost polluters, China was on top with 30% of all CO2 emissions,
whereas others such as the US, EU, India, Russia and Japan contributed 15%, 9%, 7%, 5%
and 4% of CO2 emissions, respectively [49]. The global GHG emissions can be evaluated
on the basis of different major economic sectors, such as (i) electricity and heat production;
(ii) agriculture, forestry and other land use; (iii) industry; (iv) transportation; (v) building;
and (vi) other industries. Agriculture, forestry and other land use accounted for 24% of 2010
global greenhouse gas emissions [49]. Agriculture alone had a proportion that fluctuated
between 1 and 14 percent, which is comparable to industry. Agriculture has increased its
GHG emissions by 12% since 1990. This is a result of a 9% rise in N2 O emissions from
soil management practices, as well as a 60% rise in combined CH4 and N2 O emissions
from animal manure management systems, indicating the growing usage of emissionintensive liquid systems over time. Various agricultural soil management strategies can
improve nitrogen availability in the soil and result in nitrous oxide emissions (N2 O). The
use of synthetic and organic fertilizers, the growth of nitrogen-fixing crops, the drainage
of organic soils and irrigation methods are all activities that contribute to N2 O emissions
from agricultural areas. Agricultural soil management is responsible for just over half of
the GHG emissions generated by the agriculture economic sector [49]. Fertilizing crops
with the correct quantity of nitrogen for optimal crop production can help in reducing
emission of GHGs, since excessive nitrogen application can result in increased nitrous
oxide emission without improving crop output.
GHG emissions can affect agriculture through changes in photosynthetic rates and
nutrient losses in plants [28]. Elevated CO2 concentrations increase photosynthesis and
water use efficiency, leading to reduced transpiration. However, these processes only
slightly mitigate the reduced yields caused by global warming. Rapid plant growth under
high CO2 concentrations alters the content of elements that are essential for humans and
animals. Studies have shown that cereals and legumes growing under a CO2 concentration
of 550 ppm have 3–11% lower levels of zinc and iron [45,46]. Shifting the concentration to
690 ppm resulted in decrease in mineral content in plants to about 5–13% of phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, sulfur, magnesium, iron, zinc, and copper concentration in various
crops [50]. Decline in protein and nitrogen content in edible parts of C3 plants under
elevated CO2 has also been observed [22]. Therefore, a steady increase in the concentration
of this gas may exacerbate the nutritional problems of people in poor parts of the world,
due to nutrient losses and lower yields [50].
2.3. Abiotic Stresses
Climate change leads to various abiotic stresses that affect agriculture [26,51]. Raised
temperature may lead to drought and heat stress, while variability in precipitation can cause
extreme weather events and flooding [8,41,52,53]. Another type of abiotic stress, salinity
stress, is the result of several factors [8,54,55]. Plant response to abiotic stress is mainly
determined by the type of stress, exposure time, plant species and health status. Moreover,
plants under combined stresses show lower tolerance to other factors [42]. Particular
stresses of high intensity, such as heat, can be harmful, even they are of short duration.
Mineral deficiency, on the other hand, can take months to become stressful. Natural

mechanisms for stress mitigation that plants employ include reducing organ growth rate,
closing stomata, lowering their photosynthesis rate or stimulating root growth [36,42].
There are many studies on changes in transcriptome under abiotic stress. For instance,
Cohen and Leach reported that drought stress in rice leads to changes in the transcription
of 201 core genes [42].
2.3.1. Salinization
Soil salinization, a multifactorial and complex phenomenon, is gradually affecting
more and more arable land. This excessive accumulation of mineral salts can develop in
various ways, regardless of latitude and climatic zones [9]. Arable soils that are particularly
affected by salinization process are located in arid and semiarid regions, where precipitation
is insufficient and the evapotranspiration rate is quite high [14,49]. Soil is considered as
salinity-affected when the salt concentration in the soil solution reaches 3 to 5 g per liter and
the electrolytic conductivity parameter is 2 to 4 or above 4 mSm/cm (25 ◦ C) [56]. Primary
soil salinization results from a natural salt accumulation process. This is mainly associated
with drought and extreme weather conditions. Sometimes, high salinity is the result of a
low water table, especially if the area is regularly flooded by saline water. Secondary salinity
is caused by anthropogenic activities, due to excessive irrigation and leaching of soils in
the absence of proper drainage systems [8,56–58]. The reason for high salinity may also be
the use of highly mineralized irrigation water and massive fertilization [59]. Agriculture
worldwide has always faced the problem of soil salinization [14,52]. Salinization is dynamic
and spreading in almost 100 countries with an annual growth rate of about 1–2% [9]. The
latest available data have demonstrated that salinity, together with sodicity, has affected
around 1030 million hectares (412 million hectares of saline soils and 618 million hectares
of sodic soils) of global land [60]. Initial estimates suggest that nearly one-third to even
50% of irrigated land is salt-affected, making it unsuitable for cultivation [9]. In populous
countries such as India, salinity is considered one of the greatest threats to national food
security and economic development [8].
Highly harmful salinity stress affects almost all aspects of the physiology and biochemistry of plants, and therefore contributes to a marked decrease in crop yield and
productivity [61]. High salinity is manifested not only by a decrease in dry mass, biomass
accumulation and overall water content, but also in an impaired root system, low yield,
low chlorophyll content and low seed germination rate [52,55,62–64]. The negative effects
of salinity on crops may result from the indirect action of salts in the cultivated soil or from
direct harmful effects on plants. The accumulation of salt in the soil adversely affects its
physicochemical properties, which increase the dispersion and swelling capacity, and thus
reducing the soil water permeability [65]. Such soils gradually become poorer in nutrients
and experience reduced microbial activity, which results in a decrease in biomass and
organic matter production. Land, as mentioned above, also loses its buffer and antipollution properties [56]. The long-term salinization process, without any human intervention,
results in a drastic decrease in soil fertility, and thus its uselessness [66]. Increased salt
levels not only damage soil structure and microbial activity, but they also limit plant development by generating osmotic impact, hazardous ion and mineral imbalances, or metabolic
diseases [51,67]. Osmotic stress occurs as a result of the excessive concentration of salts,
decreased water potential and plants’ inability to uptake water. Consequently, this leads to
an ion imbalance in the plants and accumulation of salts ions in plant tissues [68,69]. This
can contribute to heavy damage to plant metabolisms, which can further lead to stunted
plant growth and reduced yield [65].
Inadequate pH of soil, both very low and very high, worsens the bioavailability
of elements from the soil due to their presence in the soil in water-insoluble forms [61].
Moreover, under harsh conditions, plants need additional nutrients to cope with salinity
stress [13]. Inaccessibility of essential ions generates several harmful effects on plants,
manifested mainly by leaf chlorosis, halting increases of shoots and roots or flowering

disorders. Prolonged deficiency of required elements displays dieback of root and shoots,
followed by whole-plant death [67].
Too high a concentration of Na+ ions in the roots causes not only osmotic stress,
but also has a negative impact on the transport of K+ ions to plant cells. Moreover, a
very high Na+ ion concentration in plant cells results in various physiological disorders,
such as reduced flowering or fruiting [13]. The following metabolic processes are very
sensitive to increased salinity: transport of electrons, phosphorylation, photosynthesis and
photorespiration [48,66]. Salt stress significantly lowers the efficiency of photosynthesis
due to its multi-level action. The uptake and accumulation of Na+ and Cl− can act as
photosynthesis inhibitors which disrupt photosynthesis and reduce the production and
size of leaves, which can lead to plant death [13,70]. Nevertheless, the toxic effect of salts
is less harmful than osmotic stress. The higher concentration of ions in the environment
is accompanied by their more intensive uptake by plants. This slightly reduces the water
potential of the roots and, as a result, stimulates the water uptake by the plant [30,54].
There are several critical moments in a plant’s life which determine its vulnerability
to stresses, including high salinity. The most sensitive stages are seed germination, early
seedling growth, fertilization and pollen development [28,56]. Many studies have proven
that a high salt concentration significantly reduces the ability of seeds to germinate in
soybean, sunflower, pepper and maize [71–74]. Additionally, it has been reported that high
salinity inhibited post-germinative growth in soybean, pepper and maize [73,74]. However,
the subsequent stages of plant development in particular plants, such as peanut, could be
sensitive to excessive salinity [19,57].
Phytohormones are exceptional plant regulators and metabolic activity coordinators,
closely involved in growth and development [7,13]. These organic substances can act as
signaling molecules in response to various environmental factors [1]. For instance, auxin
stimulates the growth of adventitious roots, and cytokinin enhances cell proliferation and
delays the plant-aging processes [75,76]. Under stress conditions, poor secretion or lack
of hormones can slow down plant growth. In contrast, supplementing of hormones can
improve stress tolerance [13,77].
Plants under salinity stress tend to increase the production of the hormone ABA and
ethylene, in contrast to IAA, cytokinins, salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), whose
production is reduced [6]. Stress-derived ABA tends to decrease the water stress under
high salinity by closing the stomatal apparatus and providing osmotic adjustment [6]. This
helps in reducing water loss due to low transpiration. However, stomata that are closed
for too long reduce photosynthetic activity and accelerate aging [78]. GA plays an important role in regulating important processes in the overall plant development, including
seed germination, stem elongation and flowering [10]. Auxins can initiate root growth,
postpone leaf senescence and promote stem elongation under normal conditions [6], while
cytokinin improves cell proliferation and enlargement and the division of chloroplasts,
and simultaneously reduces stomatal closure and delay leaf senescence. SA and JA have
also been reported to be involved in various plant defense responses to alleviate salinity
stress [6,7,78]. The reduction of photosynthesis efficiency at high salinity may occur as
a result of damage to photosystem II (PSII) [74]. Insufficient water content may lead to
inhibition of photosynthesis due to a lack of substrate during the light-dependent reactions.
Additionally, lack of water, which is a natural environment for most metabolic reactions,
may reduce photosynthesis [79,80].
High salinity, similar to drought conditions, creates oxidative stress. This usually
leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of different changes
in the physiology and metabolism of plants. Under unfavorable conditions, ROS concentration increases to counteract the effects of stress. These signaling molecules may
regulate the process of programmed cell death, closing the stomata or defending plants
against pathogens [21,49,67]. However, the disturbance of cell homeostasis due to ion
imbalance generates ROS [81,82]. Excessive ROS accumulation in plant cells leads to numerous changes and damages, which in turn affect the condition of the plant, its yield

and survival [83]. This could affect DNA, chlorophyll, enzymes and other proteins, which
may lead to detrimental effects, and finally even cell death [20,84–86]. To mitigate damage
under this stress, plants have created complex antioxidative defense systems, in which
involved are antioxidative enzymes and other non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms [6].
Superoxidase dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) is mainly involved as O2 •− scavenger, which
generates H2 O2 and O2 . Therefore, H2 O2 can be scavenged by catalase (CAT EC 1.11.1.6),
ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, EC 1.11.1.7) [65,87].
It has been reported that the increase in ABA production in plants under salinity stress
induces antioxidant defense genes such as APX, SOD or CAT to remove ROS molecules [85].
Decreased activity of SOD, GPX, APX and CAT activity in roots and also CAT in leaves of a
salt-sensitive maize genotype has been demonstrated, while a salt-tolerant maize genotype
had increased SOD activity in leaves. Further, glutathione reductase (GR) may take a role in
redox balance maintaining due to reduced glutathione (GSH) restoration [88]. In addition,
non-enzymatic molecules take part in damage prevention against ROS, such as glycine
betaine or carotenoids [65,89].
Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the main product of polyunsaturated fatty acids peroxidation, and thus is used as a biomarker of oxidative stress [24,73,90]. It has been demonstrated
increased level of MDA under salinity conditions in various crops [6,90]. MDA has high
biological activity and the ability to move over long distances, so it can act far away from
the site of its origin. This organic compound tends to inactivate enzymes, and indirectly
affects the processes of protein synthesis [85].
2.3.2. Alkalinity and Acidity
Soil pH creates suitable conditions for microorganisms and plants [91,92]. The final
soil pH depends on many factors, the most important of which are precipitation and
evaporation [93]. A relatively high H+ content in relation to OH− leads to soil acidification,
while a relatively low H+ content leads to its alkalinity. Alkaline stress is a condition where
an abnormally high soil pH has occurred [94], whereas a soil is considered acidic when
the pH is below 5.5–5.0, which leads to acidic stress in plants [95]. Areas that currently
have problems with alkaline and acidic soils include China, Europe and Africa [95]. Only
4.5% of acidic soils are used in agriculture. In contrast, about half of salt-affected lands are
alkaline [95].
Extremes of pH negatively affect the physico-chemical properties and many biogeochemical processes of the soil, thus deteriorating the condition of crops and reducing yield,
which is why they are referred to as stresses [75]. Soil pH strongly has a great influence on
solubility of nutrients, and the optimum pH for the uptake of elements is slightly acidic.
Therefore, both too acidic and too alkaline conditions are unfavorable for crop production as they affect the uptake of elements [76]. Long-term stress leads to a deficiency of
nutrients that are essential for plant development and metabolic processes [95]. In addition, H+ concentration strongly influences soil structure and groundwater potential [93].
As noticed earlier, combined abiotic stresses can have a stronger negative effect on the
plant. Alkaline stress under salinity has been shown to be more detrimental than salinity
stress. Plants exposed to both acidic and alkaline environments may experience numerous
damages. Roots can suffer damage to epidermal and cortical cells, depolarization of membranes, swollen root hairs or cracks in root meristem regions [95]. Apart from the apparent
consequences for agriculture, the overall impact of acidity and alkalinity on crop health
condition is underestimated. For this reason, measures to combat this stress in particular
are limited [82].
2.3.3. Drought
Climate change is increasingly causing unexpected periods of water scarcity in habitats
that rapidly accelerate and disrupt hydrological processes. Drought as an extreme threat
to the environment can occur naturally or as a result of anthropogenic activities [41,96].
In relation to the area, the following types of droughts are distinguished: hydrological,

meteorological and agricultural. However, since they are closely related, it is difficult to
separate them [96]. Water shortage on agricultural land may be a consequence of meteorological drought, due to low precipitation. Moreover, it may be related to hydrological
drought due to insufficient amount of groundwater [73,97]. It is estimated that about 60%
of total agricultural and livestock sectors is already affected by desertification [27,74]. Apart
from water scarcity, drought leads to other harmful consequences such as increased risk of
wildfire, loss of crops and livestock, or indirect health effects on people [77].
Water deficiency in crops is mainly due to the natural effect of drought or osmotic stress
in high salinity, acidity or alkalinity [25,98]. The rate and duration of water shortage are
critical for plant adaptation and maintenance. [25]. Climate change, leading to a continuous
raise in the average temperature on Earth, is reducing water resources, resulting in an
increasing expansion of areas suffering from drought. Farmers’ struggle to combat drought
with fertilizers and irrigation only exacerbates the problem in the long run [2,27,98]. A
prominent example is the disappearance of the Aral Sea, one of the largest inland seas in
the world. As a result of irrigation of large arid areas for cotton cultivation in Central Asia,
the inflow of water into the Aral Sea has gradually declined. Only a few smaller reservoirs
remain, with salinities higher than those of the original ones [27].
Water uptake by a plant occurs vertically upward through the steam as a result of the
water potential gradient between the soil and the plant and within the plant. Lack of water
in the soil leads to a decrease in the water potential in the soil and thus to a decrease in
water uptake [70]. Thus, drought conditions generate information that is transmitted to
the plant’s leaves via ABA and other hydraulic signals. As a result, the plant protects itself
against these conditions through a number of processes, such as closing stomata [17,70].
This is to prevent the water potential inside the plant from being reduced, which would
only exacerbate the growing problem. One of the measures of soil water potential reduction
is stomatal conductance [70]. Soil water availability can be expressed as soil water content
or soil water potential. While soil water content is the amount of water present, water
potential is the amount of water available to the plant [99,100]. Thresholds of available soil
water to plants vary widely and depend on atmospheric conditions, soil type and plant
species [100].
The water requirements of plants depend on their stage of development. However
some of them are particularly susceptible to water shortage, such as the grain-filling period
or flowering [20,25]. Soil water shortage usually inhibits proper growth and development.
Less access to water increases the concentration of ions. Both water scarcity and high
salinity can create hypertonic conditions leading to osmotic stress, thus disturbing the
nutrient and water balance, the permeability of membranes, and reducing the activity of
selected enzymes [61].
ABA, the so-called stress hormone, is a key molecule in both drought and salinity
stress. It is one of the main regulators of drought mitigation processes [101,102]. The level
of the hormone correlates closely with the degree of stress, so it is a good measure of it [102].
The presence of the soluble receptor ABA in plants is unique. The increase in the level
of the hormone initiates the cellular response to this abiotic stress. As a result, the plant
closes stomata and changes the expression level of stress-related genes. Thus, the plant
tries to adapt to the new conditions. ABA plays an important role in changing the growth
ratio of shoot growth to root growth. In addition, it supports root length growth. All these
mechanisms contribute to increased water uptake by the plant [101,102].
Osmoprotectants (osmolytes), extracellular polymeric substances and volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) are the best known and are valued for their special properties. They can
increase the survival of microorganisms, but also of plants under various stress conditions,
especially in high salinity [21,49,52,103]. The accumulation of osmoprotectants, electrically
neutral, non-toxic and low molecular weight metabolites, reduces osmotic stress. Their
effectiveness is based on supporting of turgor pressure in cells and ion transport across the
plasma membrane [51,61,104]. Proline is a particularly important osmoprotectant for plants
under drought conditions. The increase in its concentration is a marker of abiotic stress

caused by water scarcity [105–107]. Proline accumulation in the cell allows reduction of the
osmotic stress caused by the reduced amount of water. This gives the plant a longer time
to survive a dry period. It also protects against numerous damages caused by abiotic stress.
Proline reduces water potential and protects cells from the toxic effects of accumulated ions.
Plant mutants that cannot produce proline are significantly less drought tolerant [106,107].
Cell growth and photosynthesis are the most sensitive processes under water deficit
conditions [37,108]. Maintaining optimal turgor of leaf cells is critical in the proper performance of photosynthesis, resulting in high photosynthetic rates. For intact and proper
functioning of the plant, undisturbed photosynthesis is required, which is a key process
that provides energy compounds and substrates for plant development. Photosynthesis
can be restricted by closed stomata, which prevents CO2 capture and thus transport of this
gas by leaf mesophyll [2,35,108]. Regulation of stomatal opening ensures proper hydration
of the plant, as well as water uptake from the soil [109]. In addition, water deficiency can
reduce chlorophyll content or cause metabolic disorders [25]. Roots, as the main water
uptake organs, play a crucial role in the survival of plants [110]. Therefore, the increased
absorption surface of the root can compensate or partially mitigate the negative effects resulting from reduced water supply. There are few hormones whose increased production is
observed in conditions of water shortage, such as ethylene, ABA and auxins. Water scarcity
decreases rates of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation due to stomatal closure [111,112].
Higher concentrations of cellular components and molecules in cells reduce viscosity. These situations endanger the plant by lowering enzymatic activity and decreasing
water flux from xylem to the cells. This may inhibit mitosis, preventing the plant from
growing [20]. Severe dehydration induces photorespiration as a result of both low CO2
concentration and the unavailability of a sufficient amount of water. Drought, similar to
salinity stress, leads to higher production of ROS, resulting in oxidative stress [88]. Certain
antioxidant enzymes, such as CAT and APX, seem to play a special role in plant tolerance
to drought stress [113]. Prolonged drought can impair photosynthesis due to a reduced
amount of chlorophyll, which in turn reduces plant growth and yield. Low concentrations
of ethylene have a positive effect on adventitious root development and fruit ripening,
while high production of ethylene under abiotic stress conditions, including drought, leads
to many harmful effects, such as inhibition of root and shoot growth, defoliation and
premature senescence [6,114].
Drought tolerance is usually the result of many biochemical and physiological adaptations, which consequently allow the plant to maintain its desired size and yield despite
unfavorable environmental conditions. However, in the case of long-term or sudden
changes, the plant is unable to cope and needs external help to survive.
3. Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria (PGPB)
3.1. About PGPB
A group of bacteria that help promote plant growth thanks to their unique properties
is called plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). PGPB isolated only from the root zone,
on the other hand, are called plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) [18,21]. It
has been estimated that only 2 to 5% of rhizosphere bacteria exhibit PGPR properties
(Table 1) [115]. PGPB can be used effectively under conditions of nutrient deficiency and
are gradually replacing fertilizers. As phytostimulants, PGPB can increase plant growth
and crop yield. Some of these bacteria can suppress phytopathogens by producing various
metabolites, which is referred to biocontrol properties [1]. The use of microorganisms
instead of synthetic chemicals provides a non-hazardous approach to plant health that increases agricultural productivity and can limit negative effects of disease [3,21,59,85,86,92].
Despite numerous benefits, the use of PGPB in agriculture is currently not the leading
trend. Many factors are to blame for this, which will be discussed later in this paper [1].
The beneficial effects on the plant through interaction with PGPB can be achieved
both directly as well as indirectly [10,79]. Direct mechanisms are based on the production
of plant growth promoting substances or biofertilization by mobilizing mineral soil compo-

nents [115]. These processes have a decisive influence on the condition of the plant and
their development [6,9,80–82]. Reducing the impact of plant diseases caused by pathogens,
mitigating abiotic stress or inducing systemic resistance in competition for nutrients and
niches are categorised as indirect mechanisms [6,83]. The most common and successful PGPB belong mainly to the genera Agrobacterium, Azospirillum, Azotobacter, Bacillus,
Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces and Serratia [52,84].
Elements such as nitrogen or phosphorous are the most limiting nutrients in crop
production [6,50]. Element fixation, solubilization and mineralization are key processes
by which microbes can enrich the soil with nutrients that can be easily taken up by
plants [1,103]. Fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere into organic forms allows plants
to assimilate these compounds. Some of the PGPB can solubilize phosphate, potassium and
zinc salts [104,116–120]. In addition, the activity of some PGPB leads to an increase in root
surface area and root morphology, which improves nutrient uptake [121]. Furthermore,
PGPB can influence ion uptake by altering the transcript levels of selected genes involved in
this process. A strain of Achromobacter isolated from Brassica napus roots enhanced the rate
of nitrate (NO3 − ) uptake by B. napus. Further, Calvo et al. showed higher transcript levels
of five nitrate and four genes responsible for ammonium uptake in Arabidopsis thaliana
treated with Bacillus sp. [122].
Phytohormones produced by bacteria can act as plant growth regulators involved
in plant development, physiology and immunity [123]. PGPB can synthesize auxins,
gibberellins, cytokinin and abscisic acid [2,99,100,108,115]. Auxins, especially indole-3acetic acid (IAA) produced by PGPB, can stimulate root growth, nodulation and cell
proliferation [7,56]. Synthesis of auxin has been demonstrated several times by different strains, mainly represented by the genera: Bacillus, Burkholderia, Serratia, Aeromonas
and Azospirillum [115]. Some PGPB are also cytokinin and gibberellin producers, but
further research is needed to determine the role of these bacterial hormones in plant
growth [2,13,124]. It has been presented that Azospirillum strains producing gibberellin
resulted in growth promotion when inoculated into maize roots [125]. In addition, Parmar et al. demonstrated the ability to produce gibberellin in fluorescent Pseudomonas
strains [124].
There are already many bacterial biofertilizers in commercial use [3]. The most common are based on nitrogen-fixing microbes, such as Nitragin Gold® containing Rhizobia,
produced in the USA [126]; Nodulest 10 with Bradyrhizobium japonicum, from Argentina,
or Azo-N with Azospirillum brasilense and Azospirillum lipoferum, from South Africa [3,127].
Some commercial biofertilizers are based on phosphate solubilizers, such as Phosphobacterin with Bacillus megaterium from Russia, or potassium solubilizers, such as K Sol B with
Frateuria aurantia, from India [3]. In addition, a few are phytostimulators, such as Amase®
with Pseudomonas azotoformans, and biocontrol agents, such as Cerall® with Pseudomonas
chlororaphis, both from Sweden [3,127].
There are several methods of PGPB application to plants. Some of the most commonly
used are carrier-based inoculation, direct soil application and seed treatment. Another
less common method is root dipping in the bacterial suspension or application of bacteria
through drip irrigation [128]. Application to the soil requires a carrier that strongly supports the survival and colonization ability of the microbe in the rhizosphere or plant [128].
Selection of individual bacteria for inoculum should be based on expected characteristics,
environmental requirements and possible interactions with the host plant and other soil
microorganisms [129]. It is highly recommended to use autochthonous microorganisms
that already have the ability to live in a particular environment, including climate and
soil type [130]. The immune system of plants is another point to consider. Plants have
multiple defense barriers and can recognize potential aggressors through pattern recognition receptors [129]. PGPB candidates should be competitive enough to successfully
colonize plants. Microbial consortia, as a group of species acting together as a community,
improve and maintain the soil physical and chemical properties [129]. Some of the PGPB
act synergistically when applied together or coexist, such as B. subtilis with mycorrhizal

fungi [9,19]. Gomez-Godinez et al. revealed a stronger effect on maize when using multispecies inoculum of PGPB than single bacteria [131]. Inoculation with a single microbial
culture may place the isolates in a worst position, because may suffer from competitive
and deleterious effects of local soil microorganisms [108,132].
The biocontrol properties of selected PGPB reduce the survival of phytopathogens
and thus protect plants from certain pathogens. Biocontrol properties are the result of
many different adaptations to the environment. They may synthesise different hydrolytic
enzymes such as cellulases, proteases and β-glucanases [105,113]. In addition to these
enzymes, they can produce many other substances such as siderophores, hormones, HCN
and various volatile organic compounds [125]. Studies have showed that B. altitunidis KP-14
had antagonistic activity against both fungi Fusarium culmorum and Botrytis cinerea, and also
Bacillus sp. KP-18 against F. culmorum [133]. Cytokinin secreted by Pseudomonas fluorescens
G20-18 is an important biocontrol agent against the pathogenetic Pseudomonas syringae
for A. thaliana [123]. Selected strains of Bacillus subtilis have antifungal activity against
Fusarium oxysporium and Rosellinia necatrix due to antibiotic production [134]. Antagonism
of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens against Fusarium oxysporum has also been reported [117].
3.2. Abiotic Stress Tolerant PGPB
Abiotic stresses, as mentioned earlier, adversely impact on physical-chemical soil
properties and microbial communities [23,103,135]. As a selection factor, long-term abiotic
stress contributes to the evolution of specific microorganisms, able to survive in adverse
environmental conditions [23,104]. Bacteria belonging to particular species differ in stress
tolerance. Although some species do well with abiotic stresses, because of individual
properties, only selected strains are able to live under particular conditions [136,137].
Some of the PGPB are able to survive and proliferate under stressful conditions due
to different adaptation mechanisms [13]. In this work, we refer to these microbes as
abiotic stress tolerant growth promoting bacteria (AST-PGPB). Normally, microorganisms
require a longer period of adaptation under rapid environmental changes when interacting
with the host plant. The composition of root exudates tends to change under particular
stressful conditions. Synthesis of particular substances can stimulate the mechanisms of
counteracting abiotic stress in microorganisms [136,138]. Therefore, selected biochemical
compounds may participate in the close interaction between microbes and plants by
activating specific microbial stress genes. Such plant-associated microorganisms generally
adapt much faster to new stress conditions, which supports microbial survival. This
unusual relation makes AST-PGB an efficient tool for promoting plant growth under abiotic
stress conditions [18,135]. It has been reported that some AST-PGPB are even more active
under harsh environmental conditions [52,84]. Nagaraju et al. demonstrated that the
solubilization of zinc compounds decreases significantly with increasing salinity [139]. In
addition, selected AST-PGPB may not exhibit PGPB properties or promote plant growth
under standard conditions. However, when used under harsh conditions, they may exhibit
growth-promoting and stress-alleviating effects [18,52,61].
Selected AST-PGPB have evolved different adaptation mechanisms to specific abiotic
stresses or multi-stress conditions in the soil (Table 1). Thanks to plant growth promoting
properties, these microbes can help plants tremendously to cope with the effects of abiotic
stress [53]. The ability of AST-PGPB to produce specific secondary metabolites to combat
the effects of abiotic stress is increasingly appreciated due to its beneficial effects on
crops [67]. Osmoprotectants, as highly soluble organic substances, can be produced by the
microorganisms and released into the external environment [13]. Some plants may lack the
machinery to produce certain osmolytes, so external additions using microbes are highly
desirable. AST-PGPB can accumulate proline, glycine-betaine, glutamate and trehalose,
which can help them to cope with osmotic stress [21,117,136]. It was found that the survival
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa GG RJ21 under drought stress conditions was possible due to
mass production of glycine-betaine and proline [109], while Azospirillum spp. strains can
also accumulate proline, trehalose and glycine-betaine. In addition, proline has osmolytic

properties and also acts as a ROS scavenger involved in protein stabilization [67]. The
production of extracellular polymeric substances is an important criterion for the selection
of candidates for AST-PGPB [13]. Exopolysaccharide (EPS) secretion allows bacteria to
protect themselves from harsh environmental conditions through their bacterial biofilm.
EPS can mobilize certain ions, store nutrients, participate in the formation of microconsortia
and promote colonization of root surfaces [140,141]. Bacteria are able to tolerate wide
fluctuations of various environmental factors due to stabilizing the cell membrane against
external factors through EPS [125]. It was shown that strain mutants of P. aeruginosa
exhibited an 86% reduction in EPS lost tolerance to high salinity compared to control strain
P. aeruginosa PF23 [142].
Some of AST-PGPB bacteria exposed to abiotic stress conditions are capable of producing VOCs. These lipophilic, low molecular weight compounds are often produced by
microbes as regulators of various properties [56,143]. Plants can use these substances as
indicators, by which they recognize microbial species of with which they interact profitably [67]. Mainly, the production of acetoin, butanediol, 1,3-propanediol, geosmin and
dimethyl disulfide by bacteria have been reported [67,117]. However it is estimated that
thousands of such compounds are produced by different bacteria, such as alcohols, alkanes,
alkenes, aldehydes, esters, ketones, organic acids or sulfur compounds [144].
4. PGPB and Its Role in Inducing Different Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Plants
Acclimatization of plants under drought and high salinity conditions is usually possible through natural physiological and biochemical adaptations [145]. Under conditions
of prolonged or severe abiotic stress, the use of PGPR capable of tolerating these harsh
conditions may be critial [53]. Inoculation of properly selected AST-PGPB can mitigate
the effects of abiotic stresses by acting directly on plants or by positively modulating the
plant’s natural defenses (Figure 1) [18,48,146].
4.1. PGPB Induced Salinity Tolerance
Selected salinity-tolerant bacteria are able to produce hormones, ACC deaminase,
osmoprotectants or secondary compounds, such as EPS and VOCs, under high-salinity
conditions (Figure 1) [55,119,123,130]. AST-PGPB inoculation may lead to positive adaptive
responses of plants to salinity stress. This can occur through several mechanisms, including
altered hormone production by the plant, increased nutrient uptake, lowering water stress,
maintainance of favourable K+ /Na+ ratio or osmotic adjustment (Table 1) [52,67,123].
Several genera are involved in the successful control of salinity stress in crops, such as
Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Streptomyces or Ochromobacter [52,105,147,148]. Many
studies have been conducted to verify the prevalence of salinity-tolerant strains. The
dominance of 8% NaCl-tolerant Bacillus sp. in the wheat rhizosphere was observed [149].
Zhang et al. reported that of 305 bacteria isolated from paddy soil in Taoyuan, China,
35.7%, 15.1% and 4.9% of the strains were able to grow in media with 5%, 10% and 15%
NaCl concentrations, respectively [150]. Most of these isolates exhibited plant growth
promoting potential in rice cultivation under high salinity stress. Moreover, phylogenetic
analysis of 74 selected isolates revealed that most of bacteria belonged to the order Bacillales.
However, one of the best salinity tolerances for field strains, up to 20%, was found for
Klebsiella sp. IG3 isolated from wheat rhizosphere [151]. In addition, it has been reported
that multispecies inoculum consisting of endophytic and rhizosphere PGPB under salinity
stress may increase crop yield [13].

Many studies have proven that selected bacterial strains are able to mitigate the overall
negative effect under salt stress conditions. Pseudomonas sp. M30-35 isolated from Haloxylon
ammodendron improved the growth and total biomass of quinoa under 300 mM NaCl [152],
while Azotobacter vinellandii SRIAz3, isolated from the rice rhizosphere, increased fresh
biomass under 200 mM NaCl and perennial ryegrass under 150 and 300 mM NaCl [24,153].
The mitigation of the effects of salt stress by AST-PGPB may occur at the level of gene
transcription. The comparative transcriptome study showed a change in the activation of
multiple genes in maize inoculated with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SN13 [80]. In addition,
34 genes with homology to genes associated with different PGP attributes were described
in salt-tolerant Pseudomonas sp. M30-35 [24].
The salinity tolerance of plants may result from their ability to maintain a high
concentration of K+ to Na+ ions or to suppress the influence of Na+ ions on the root
cells [52,154,155]. The natural mechanism of bacterial salinity tolerance is to avoid high
salt concentrations in the cytoplasm. Salinity-tolerant bacteria can eliminate the excess
salt by Na+ /H+ anitiporters or prevent salt from flowing inside [13]. This can make the
bacteria extremely resistant to high salinity, even if they occur naturally in a low salinity
environment. Rice inoculated with Bacillus pumilus resulted in limited uptake of Na+ under
150 mM NaCl. The reduction of a toxic high level of Na+ ions resulted in an increase in
shoot growth compared to the control [156]. Sunflower inoculated with P. fluorescens CECT
378T under 100 mM NaCl salinity also increased the K+ /Na+ ratio in the shoot, which
supported the accumulation of plant biomass [157]. P. putida Rs-198 increased Mg2+ , K+
and Ca2+ and decreased Na+ uptake by soil affected cotton seedling roots [158]. Rhizobium
and Pseudomonas lead to lack of Na+ accumulation in maize salinity affected [53]. In turn,
maize inoculated with Azotobacter chroococcum enhanced Na+ exclusion and K+ uptake
in maize, which also increased the K+ /Na+ ratio. This experiment was performed under
different salinity conditions, but plant promotion was observed only under 2.93 and 5.85 g
NaCl/kg concentrations [159].
Some AST-PGPB may increase nutrients availability to plants by chelation or acidification of soil (Figure 1). Phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen or zinc deficiency in soil could
be minimized through bacterial solubilization activity, thus dissolving both inorganic and
organic phosphorus and to maintain soil nutrient levels [21,49,62]. Phosphate mobilization
along with other PGPB traits, such as IAA and siderophore production, enhanced chlorophyll content in pepper inoculated with M. oleivorans KNUC7074, B. iodinum KNUC7183,
or R. massiliae KNUC7586, under 200 mM NaCl [160]. Phosphate solubilization activity
was also reported by Habib et al., where rice was inoculated Bacillus sp. UPMR7 and
Citrobacter sp. UPMR17., and by Palaniyandi et al., where tomato was inoculated with
Streptomyces sp. PGPA39 [143,161]. Likewise in these experiments, an increased amount
of chlorophyll was observed. Phosphate solubilization also has been reported by Hahm
et al., where Rhizobium massiliae KNUC7586, Microbacterium oleivorans KNUC7074 and
Brevibacterium iodinum KNUC7183, through IAA and siderophore production, increased
leaf water content in pepper, under 200 mM NaCl [160]. Phosphate solubilization is also
crucial for root system improvement. Various strains, such as Streptomyces sp., Bacillus sp.
and Arthrobacter pascens, used for wheat, rice and maize crop, respectively, resulted in root
system growth enhancement [142,144,162]. Salt-tolerant phosphate solubilizing strains
B. pumilus FAB10 increased wheat yield under salinity stress up to 250 mM NaCl [163].
Some phosphate solubilizers increased shoot length in pepper and rice under 200 mM
and 150 mM NaCl, respectively [141,164]. Wheat inoculated with phosphate solubilizer
Streptomyces spp. increased uptake of nitrogen, iron, phosphorous and manganese by the
roots [165]. It has been demonstrated that maize inoculated with Rhizobium or Pseudomonas
increased selective ion uptake under salinity conditions. Particular bacteria are able to
dissolve other crucial minerals for plant growth. Ashfaq et al. have reported about halotolerant rhizobacteria, which may improve potassium availability under salinity stress [112].
Twenty-nine isolates out of 50 halophilic rhizobacteria were able to solubilize zinc carbonate and zinc oxide, under 3% NaCl concentration, while 10 isolates solubilized zinc

carbonate under 10% concentration of NaCl [139]. It has also been reported that selected
salt-tolerant PGPB may also increase iron, copper, zinc, manganese content due to their
activity [13,125,166,167].
Regulation of cell membrane permeability and thus control of water movement
through organs is an important adaptive mechanism under osmotic stress, caused by
high salinity [10,72]. The accumulation of proteins or amino acids in leaves helps protect cell structures from denaturation in the event of dehydration. Certain osmolytes can
lower the osmotic potential under water stress. This osmotic adjustment helps maintain
plant cell turgor under salinity and drought stresses [142,146]. It has been reported that
maize co-inoculated with Rhizobium and Pseudomonas lowered osmotic potential due to
enhanced proline production, resulting in higher water content in leaves [53]. Additionally, peanut inoculated Brachybacterium saurashtrense (JG-06), Brevibacterium casei (JG-08) or
Haererohalobacter (JG-11) increased shoot and root water content due to higher proline and
soluble sugar production [53]. Chickpea inoculated with A. lipoferum FK1, also showed
higher accumulation of proline and glycine-betaine, as well as proteins and sugars under
salinity stress exhibited [168]. Rice inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens SN13 and Azotobacter
vinellandii SRIAz3 produced more proline, resulting in increased plant biomass [80,169].
AST-PGPB could directly affect plant metabolism through hormone production, thus
enhancing plant growth under saline conditions [7,52,170]. In addition, some of the ASTPGPB hormone producers may also shift the synthesis of selected hormones in plants under
various abiotic stresses [157,158]. It has been reported that IAA producing bacteria are very
common within the AST-PGPB group [24,83,171]. Pepper inoculated with IAA-producing
bacteria M. oleivorans KNUC7074, B. iodinum KNUC7183, and R. massiliae KNUC7586
increased chlorophyll concentration, as well as leaf water content under 200 mM NaCl
salinity [160]. A similar effect was reported in rice inoculated with Bacillus sp. UPMR7
and Citrobacter sp. UPMR17 or tomato crop using Streptomyces sp. PGA39 [172,173].
Yao et al. studied the growth promotion of cotton seedling inoculated with P. putida Rs198 [158]. Germination rate increased 23.8% under saline soil conditions compared to
control conditions. Moreover, cotton seedlings inoculated with strain P. putida Rs-198
improved production of IAA and reduced ABA synthesis, which resulted in increased
Mg2+ , K+ and Ca2+ and decreased Na+ uptake by roots [158].
It has been widely reported that IAA producers among AST-PGPB play an important
role in improving root system architecture and length [57,64]. IAA promotes root initiation,
reinforcement of lateral and adventitious roots, which increases water absorption surface.
Sadeghi et al. reported that Streptomyces sp. increases N, Fe, P, and Mn uptake by wheat
due to IAA and siderophore production and phosphate solubilization [165]. Yasin et al.
observed increased root length of pepper by 87.3% and 69.8% in salt-stressed conditions
using Bacillus fortis SSB21 and SSB13 strains, respectively, compared to control [174]. The
experiment also proved that auxins play a special role in promoting plant growth, especially
lengthening the shoot. Pepper-inoculated IAA producers M. oleivorans KNUC7074, R.
massiliae KNUC7586 and B. iodinum KNU7183 increased shoot length by 33%, 35% and 37%,
respectively, compared to control, under 200 mM NaCl [160]. Further, there are cytokinin,
gibberellin and ABA PGPB producers [125]. It has been reported that Pseudomonas putida
and Novosphingobium sp. are able to decrease the production of the hormones ABA and
SA in citrus plants under salinity stress. An increase in these hormones was observed in
control [175].
Ethylene as a gaseous hormone regulates growth, senescence, and stress tolerance in
plants at low concentrations [55,149], while increased concentration of ethylene negatively
affects root growth. Plants produce this gas from 1-aminocyclopropane-1-decarboxylate
(ACC). The enzyme ACC deaminase degrades ACC to α-ketoglutarate and NH3 , thus
preventing further ethylene production. ACC deaminase-producing microbes such as
actinomycetes can uptake ACC, metabolize it, and thus lower the ethylene concentration in the plant [55,98,176]. Some bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas sp., Variovorax
paradoxus and Rhizobium phaseoli, are great salinity alleviators due to ACC deaminase

activity [114,170,177]. Selected ACC deaminase producers at AST-PGPB may show other
properties. Streptomyces sp. PGPA39-inoculated tomato under salinity stress was able to
alleviate salinity stress by phosphate solubilization, ACC deaminase and IAA production [173]. This strain enhanced chlorophyll and water content. Rice inoculated with
ACC-deaminase-producer Curtobacterium albidum SRV4 increased yield under salt stress,
compared to controlled conditions [178]. Wheat inoculated with B. pumilus FAB10 increased
yield by 10.2% under 250 mM NaCl concentration [163]. Moreover, Burkholderia sp. MTCC
was able to promote the growth of rice seedlings due to ACC deaminase production and
higher antioxidant activity [54].
Some of the AST-PGPB can enhance photosynthesis under salinity stress. Ribulose-1,5bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1.1.39), commonly known as RuBisCo, plays
crucial role in CO2 fixation during the dark stage of photosynthesis [179]. Positive upregulation of rbcL, gene encoding RuBisCo in the oat seedlings inoculated with Klebsiella
sp. under 100 mM NaCl salinity stress, resulted in enhanced photosynthetic activity [151].
Moreover, photosynthesis may be intensified as a result of the increased chlorophyll content.
In addition, inoculation of bacteria, which exhibit typical growth promotion traits such as
IAA production, phosphate solubilization or N-fixation were able to increase chlorophyll
content in pepper, rice or tomato crops [160,172,173].
As mentioned earlier, EPS makes bacteria more tolerant to osmotic stress. EPS can
participate in the control of stomatal movement, hydraulic conductance and transpiration,
and maintains integrity of plant cells [67]. These actions allow the plant to maintain
adequate hydration. The positive effect of EPS on proper hydration through improved
K+ /Na+ ratio was demonstrated by Yang et al. in which quinoa was inoculated with
Enterobacter sp. MN17 and Bacillus sp. MN54 under 100 mM NaCl [58]. Decreased Na+
uptake reduces osmotic stress, thus producing enhanced plant growth. Production of EPS
by Rhizobium sp. IC3123 under 16 mM NaCl enhanced the germination process, seed yield
and nodule formation in the pigeon pea, in both field and pot experiments [161]. Tewari and
Arora reported the influence of EPS producer P. aeruginosa P23 on increased sunflower yield
under 500 mM NaCl [142]. In addition, it was revealed that EPS can enhance plant hormone
production. Sunflower inoculated with P. aeruginosa P23 under 500 mM NaCl, and canola
inoculated with B. iodinum RS16, Micrococcus yunnanensis RS222, Brevibacterium aryabhattai
RS341 and Bacillus licheniformis RS656, under 100 mM NaCl, resulted in higher production
of SA and growth hormones, respectively [165,173]. Moreover, its properties could result
from its ability to form a biofilm on plant roots, especially under high salinity. B. pumilus
FAB10 showed biofilm formation on the surface of wheat roots at a salt concentration of
250 mM. B. pumilus increased biofilm synthesis with increasing salinity, between 125 and
250 mM NaCl, which was accompanied with higher EPS production [141].
Selected AST-PGPB are able to produce high amount of antioxidant enzymes, mainly
SOD, POD, CAT, GR and nitrate reductase (NR), under salinity stress [78,174,180,181].
Reduced production of antioxidant enzymes is observed in situations with low tolerance
to salt stress in the plant. In such cases, it is worth supporting their growth with bacteria
that can produce such enzymes in high concentrations [53]. Plants inoculated with selected
bacteria under salinity stress conditions can increase the synthesis of these enzymes by
the plant itself. Their action may simply assist plants to synthesize such enzymes. This
creates an opportunity to use bacteria with increased salinity tolerance to mitigate the
effects of salinity stress, even if they do not produce these enzymes. Chickpea inoculated
with A. lipoferum FK1 resulted in increased production of antioxidant enzymes. This strain
enhanced the transcription of three antioxidant genes encoding CAT, APX, and SOD, as
well as six other genes involved in the alleviation of abiotic stress [168]. The enhanced
antioxidant enzymes’ production stimulated the growth of chickpeas due to the increased
protection of chloroplasts. Kohler et al. have been reported that Pseudomonas mendocina
increased APX and CAT production in lettuce under salinity conditions [182]. Inoculation
of these bacteria reduced the damage from oxidative stress and increased the shoot biomass.
Wheat inoculated with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SBP-9 isolated from Sorghum bicolor,

resulted in increased production of SOD (26–41%), CAT (24–56%), and POX (27–44%) [183].
Wheat seeds inoculated with B. pumilus FAB10 resulted in decreased salinity stress, which
was manifested by a decrease in the production of selected antioxidant enzymes [141].
Wheat seeds treated with B. pumilus FAB10 showed a 20% increase in CAT production
despite different salinity concentrations: 75, 125, and 250 mM NaCl, compared with control
conditions. While unprimed seeds increased of CAT enzyme production, relative to control
40%, 80% and 80% for 75, 125, and 250 mM NaCl, respectively. A significant decrease
in SOD and GR production was also observed as compared to seeds untreated with B.
pumilus FAB10. Has been reported that rice seeds treated with halotolerant Enterobacter
P23 under 150 mM NaCl decreased level of SOD, CAT and peroxidase in plants [184].
These data may indicate that appropriate strain adjustment under specific conditions can
bring great benefits despite harsh environmental conditions. Due to the high production of
ROS by plants under salinity stress, the quenchers of these molecules are critical for crop
survival. Rice inoculated with Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes and B. pumilus reduced lipid
peroxidation process and SOD under 1.5% saline conditions [53]. Rice inoculated with
A. vinellandia SRIAz3, isolated from the rice rhizosphere, shows a high concentration of
proline and MDA under 200 mM NaCl [169].
Although salinity can seriously affect crop growth and yield, there are numerous
salinity-tolerant microorganisms are available, as seen above. Due to their several beneficial
traits, they are able to mitigate the effects of stress in various crops. However, it should be
kept in mind that the effect of inoculation on crop health and yield depends on a number
of factors besides soil and nutrient status. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly study the
influence of microorganisms with different characteristics on counteracting the effects of
salt stress.
4.2. PGPB Induced Drought Tolerance
Soil water shortage adversely affects plants, often inhibiting their proper growth
and development. Less access to water increases the concentration of ions. Both water
scarcity and high salinity can create hypertonic conditions, leading to osmotic stress,
thus disturbing the nutrient and water balance, the permeability of membranes and and
reducing the activity of selected enzymes [147]. Drought tolerance is usually the result of
many biochemical and physiological adaptations, which consequently allow the plant to
maintain its desired size and yield despite unfavorable environmental conditions. However,
in the case of long-term or sudden changes, the plant is unable to cope and needs external
help to survive.
Abiotic stress-tolerant PGPB may beneficially influence the plant growth and development under water deficit conditions, thus conferring tolerance to drought stress (Figure 1).
There are several mechanisms of AST-PGPB that lead to increased water absorption despite
drought symptoms (Table 1) [185]. AST-PGPB may confer drought tolerance in plants
mainly by (i) hormone production, (ii) ACC deaminase production, (iii) osmoprotectant
accumulation, (iv) solubilization activity and (v) regulation of stress-responsive genes
(Figure 1) [6,111,186]. There are several genera that are used to alleviate drought stress in
crops, such as Azospirillum, Bacillus, Pseudomonas or Microbacterium [135,137,163,186]. Most
of drought tolerant PGPB strains are plant hormone producers. In lower concentrations,
auxin, as mentioned before in this paper, promotes root growth and branching and supports
overall vigorous root growth, and thus water and nutrient uptake capacity [47,186,187].
Increased ABA, GA and IAA reduced drought stress due to maize inoculated endophytic
A. lipoferum.
Bacterial GA and ABA increased leaves compared to the control treated with these
hormone inhibitors under drought stress [188]. The experiment proved a significant role
of these hormones in plant growth and drought tolerance. In addition, JA plays a role in
alleviating drought stress by increasing antioxidant activity. Therefore, bacteria increasing
JA hormone production may enhance drought tolerance [189]. P. putida H-2-3 mitigated
the drought and salinity stress effects on soybean by GA production ability. Soybean

inoculated P. putida H-2-3, compared to the control under drought conditions, exhibited
slightly better chlorophyll content (1.2%), but primarily a greater shoot length (13.6%) and
plant fresh weight (12.8%) [13]. Sarma and Saikia have reported that mungbeans inoculated
with Pseudomonas aeruginosa GGRJ21 under 0.73 MPa drought conditions enhanced their
biomass and growth in field conditions compared to control [109]. Bacterial inoculation
promoted root length in the plants by 127% and shoot length by 42% under water stress
conditions. The elongation of the roots and shoots was possible due to IAA production
and the stress reduction effects through the ACC deaminase activity. Moreover, bacterial up-regulated transcription of stress responsive genes, which contributes to the plant
stress tolerance [109]. Cytokinin as a natural plant hormone supports the young plant,
thus preventing leaves scarcity. However, its synthesis during drought is limited [189].
Inoculation of cytokinin-producing strain B. subtilis on Platycladus orientalis elevated cytokinin in shoots under drought stress [190]. It was noted that GA plays a crucial role
in the control of the degree of opening of the stomata, and therefore is responsible for
the process of stomatal transpiration. In times of drought, access to water is negligible,
so closing the apparatuses may reduce water losses [191]. Bacterial inoculation elevated
ABA and reduced drought stress. Cucumber inoculated with of P. putida enhanced shoot
length and biomass due to higher endogenous GA production in plants [13]. Azosprillum
brasilense Sp245 inoculation elevated ABA and reduced drought stress in Arabidopsis [192].
Phyllobacterium brassicacearum STM196 inoculated with rapeseed increased osmotic stress
tolerance under drought stress due to elevated ABA concentration. Moreover, A. brasilense
due to nitric oxide production enhanced adventitious root development in tomato, which
could be another mechanism of drought stress alleviation [193].
Maize inoculated with A. brasilense enhanced proline accumulation, plant water content, biomass and leaves area of plant under drought stress [192]. Additionally, it has been
reported that wheat inoculated with A. brasilense Sp245 under drought conditions increased
yield, mineral uptake and water content in the plant [194]. Similarly, maize inoculated
with P. putida GAP-45 increased relative water content due to proline accumulation under
drought stress [195]. Increased proline accumulation was also observed in Lavandula dentata
inoculated with B. thuringiensis and tomato inoculated with Bacillus polymyxa [196,197].
Intact and proper functioning of the plant requires undisturbed photosynthesis, which
is a key process that provides energy compounds and substrates for plant development.
Maintaining the optimal turgor of leaf cells is crucial in the proper performance of photosynthesis, resulting in a high photosynthetic rate. Regulating the opening of stomatal apertures
ensures proper hydration of the plant, as well as water uptake from the soil [124]. ABA
hormone may regulate the closure of stomata under drought to avoid water loss [42]. Some
AST-PGPB also have the ability to produce osmoprotectants under abiotic stress, particularly drought [105]. The accumulation of these compounds decreases the water potential in
the leaves and thus their natural transport from stems by suction force. Plants treated with
PGPB may exhibit higher content of antioxidant enzymes and cell osmolytes [109]. Wheat
inoculated with Azospirillum sp. maintained hydration as a result of decreased leaf water
potential and increased leaf water relative content due to auxin production, phosphate
solubilization and ACC deaminase activity by bacteria [63].
Improvement of leaf water status in mung bean under drought conditions was reported [109]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa GGRJ21 resulted in proline synthesis and enhanced
accumulation along with antioxidant enzymes in plants. Trehalose, natural non-reducing
sugar accumulation, has been found to be osmoprotective in both bacteria and plants. It
may also be involved in enzymes and membrane stabilization [192]. The experiments conducted by Vílchez et al. using a collection of desiccation-tolerant microorganisms revealed
again the role of trehalose, as well as hormones produced by bacteria [111]. Pepper and
tomato treated with Microbacterium sp. 3J1 under severe drought conditions showed the
highest values of relative water content, dry weight and fresh weight. This strain showed
the highest production of ACC deaminase and was able to synthesize the hormones IAA,
GA and SA. Trehalose can regulate the expression of genes responsible for the production

of antioxidant enzymes, as well as modulate their activity [111]. Moreover, modification of
the P. putida KT2440 strain to overproduce trehalose resulted in increased plant tolerance
to desiccation [111]. Other osmoprotectants’ accumulation, such as glycine betaine, may
increase water content. Maize inoculated with Klebsiella variicola F2, P. fluorescens YX2,
and Raoultella planticola YL2 and Arabidopsis inoculated B. subtilis GB03 due to choline
accumulation, as a precursor of glycine-betaine increased water content, thus enhancing
drought tolerance of this plant [198,199]. Drought, similar to high salinity conditions, may
generate a large number of ROS molecules in plants. Reducing the negative effects of
stress, especially biomass losses caused by the formation of a high concentration of ROS, is
possible thanks to scavenging mechanisms [65,112]. Lower content of antioxidant enzymes
compared to control conditions may indicate drought stress amelioration. For instance,
rice inoculated with Bacillus sp., as well as with a particular PGPB consortium, resulted in
decreased levels of GPOX (20%), CAT (20.5%) and SOD (24%) in plants compared to those
untreated, under drought stress [200].

salinity stresses.
Abiotic Stress

Table 1. Cont.
Abiotic Stress

Water scarcity decreases the rate of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation due to stomatal
closure. Severe dehydration induces photorespiration as a result of both low CO2 concentration and the unavailability of a sufficient amount of water. Particular antioxidative
enzymes, such as CAT and APX, seem to play an important role in plant tolerance to
drought stress [205]. Prolonged drought can interfere with photosynthesis due to the
reduced amount of chlorophyll, which in turn reduces plant growth and yield.
Slower root growth under drought stress conditions reduces the area of uptake of both
water and nutrients. Wheat inoculated with three Azospirillum sp. strains AZ1, AZ9 and
AZ45 increased yield compared to uninoculated treatments under varied drought stress.
AZ45 increased wheat yield by 43% and 109% due to N fixation, IAA, ACC deaminase
production and phosphate solubilization [63]. Relative water content was increased by this
strain by 6.1% and 1.8%, while strain AZ1 raised relative water content by 3.3% and 7.8%
due to N fixation, IAA and ACC deaminase production. In addition, maize inoculated with
Bacillus sp. increased K+ and P+ uptake, as well as proline accumulation under drought
stress, which resulted in increased leaf biomass [88]. Increased phosphates uptake occurred
due to the phosphorous solubilization properties of strains. The authors mentioned the
correlation between proline accumulation and root growth, the activity of antioxidant
enzymes and the uptake of K+ ions. Proline itself exhibits an antioxidant capacity and is
involved in the stabilization of membranes and proteins, and thus participates in osmotic
adjustment, which seems to be crucial in drought conditions [88]. Water stress may
also decrease the nitrate reductase activity in plants and bacteria, thus leading to nitrate
accumulation and inhibiting plant growth. However, due to the hormones produced by
plants inoculated by Azospirillum strains, increased nitrogen and other nutrient uptake was
observed [63,211]. Drought also affects the composition of plant cell membranes. It has
been reported that Azospirillum strains can also prevent negative changes in membrane
composition in wheat seedlings [192].
Low concentrations of ethylene have a positive effect on adventitious root development and fruit ripening, while high production of ethylene under abiotic stress conditions,
including drought, leads to many harmful effects, such as inhibition of root and shoot
growth, defoliation and premature senescence [6,114]. Saikia et al. reported on the potential
benefits of employing a consortium of ACC-deaminase generating bacteria to alleviate
drought stress in black gram and garden pea [105]. Other plants, such as tomato and pepper, inoculated with ACC deaminase producing Achromobacter piechaudii ARV8, showed
beneficial impacts, such as increased growth, particularly fresh and dry weights, under
drought stress [202]. Garden pea inoculated with the ACC deaminase producer P. fluorescens
resulted in longer roots, and thus increased water uptake, under drought stress [207].
Plants exposed to drought stress may produce VOCs as a signal molecule involved
in plant tolerant responses. Alleviation mechanisms could be based on properties of
VOCs produced by AST-PGPB or enhancing synthesis of these molecules in plants due to
bacteria’s other activities [192]. It has also been reported that 2R, 3R- butanediol released
by P. chlororaphis O6 reduces water loss by Arabidopsis due to better control of stomata
closure under drought conditions [205]. Another mechanism to counteract drying out is the
EPS accumulation produced by AST-PGPB. Bacteria due to EPS production can produce a
biofilm, which creates a microenvironment beneficial for both sides, bacteria and plant, for
a long time [168,189]. EPS-coated roots are well protected from desiccation, making them
less exposed to the negative effects of drought stress. In addition, bacterial EPS released
into the soil can improve soil structure, retain soil water, and increase bacterial colonization
on the roots [215]. EPS’s special role in drought stress alleviation has been reported by
Sandhya et al. [195]. Sunflower inoculated with P. putida GAP-45 increased relative water
content. Moreover, these bacteria enhanced soil aggregation. EPS production has a positive
influence on osmolytes accumulation, thus enabling water adjustment in plants. Under the
influence of EPSproducing bacteria, various selected plants have been observed exhibiting
reduced levels of antioxidant enzymes [118,120,159].

In conclusion, drought tolerance in crops can be increased by inoculation with droughtresistant bacteria. When selecting an appropriate microorganism, the intensity of drought,
its length, other climatic factors and the type of crop should be taken into account. Among
the bacteria, there are species that cope well with the conditions of a low level or lack of
water in soil. Strains belonging to Azospirillum, Pseudomonas and Bacillus are among the
most promising potential candidates for AST-PGPB due to their extreme drought tolerance
and display numerous PGPB characteristics. EPS-producing bacteria cope best in drought
conditions, while plant growth and reduction of drought stress is possible thanks to ACC
deaminase activity and hormone production.
4.3. Challenges and Limitations Associated with PGPB Application
There are a number of articles, some of which have also been discussed in this article, illustrating the benefits of PGPB in boosting plant growth and development under
abiotic stress [5,54,67,216]. The beneficial role of PGPB has already been confirmed by
successful experiments in laboratories and under controlled conditions. Despite having
a fair understanding of microbial efficiency, there is still a need for rigorous research to
translate these approaches to the field [67,113,123,155]. To bridge this significant gap in the
use of microbes or microbe-based chemicals from laboratory to field scale, it is necessary
to comprehend the various issues related to inconsistencies, ambiguities and problems in
application methods, etc. According to several researchers, one of the reasons for the poor
performance of the microbial community under natural circumstances is a lack of information about the optimal carrier in traditional formulations (solid and liquid) [4,171,217]. The
carrier material used to make a suitable formulation is critical for protecting the microorganisms from adverse conditions throughout storage, transportation, and their residence
in the soil [217,218]. The microbial formulations are available primarily in two forms:
liquid suspensions and solid powders or beads. Peat, turf, lignite, alginate, press mud,
vermiculate and zeolite are some of the carrier materials utilized in formulation. These
carriers may provide nourishment to the microbial community. On the other hand, they
can protect the microbes from harsh environments and desiccation, thus extending their
shelf life. The marketing and commercialization of microbial-based products depends on
market demand, consistency, broad spectrum action, environmental safety, cheap capital
cost, environmentally friendly behavior and strong collaboration between industry and
research [120,219,220]. Some of the major factors limiting the success of PGPB are: (i) crop
specificity of PGPB products; (ii) selection of potent PGPB isolates for product formation;
(iii) farmers’ attitude; (iv) stability of PGPB formulation; (v) performance under different
climatic conditions; and (vi) lack of skilled manpower for microbial product application.
5. Conclusions and Future Prospects
The continuous increase in energy consumption together with land use for agriculture leads to the GHG emissions that trap solar radiation in the atmosphere. Variation in
precipitation, melting glaciers, reduced snow cover and rising ocean levels are the main
signs of climate change caused by an increase in average temperature. It is likely that as
climate change progresses in the 21st century, significant areas of high-quality farmland
will be lost to due to sea rise, erosion, salinization and desertification [13,20]. Climate
change is constantly exacerbating the problem of declining available cropland and freshwater resources. This aggravates the imbalance between wealthy and developing human
communities. Underdeveloped nations, particularly on the African continent, are expected
to be the hardest hit by elevated temperatures [53]. Climate change will only worsen the
existing problems of water scarcity and the prevailing drought. Projections indicate that
some crops will no longer be possible due to water shortage or soil degradation. On the
other hand, more developed countries, especially southern and eastern Australia and New
Zealand, will see their crop significantly reduced due to rising temperatures and drought.
In particular, the struggle with drought and salinity is one of the toughest challenges in
agriculture since many decades ago [217].

One of the greatest challenges facing mankind in the times ahead is to provide for the
possibility of cultivation despite growing problems related mainly to drought and salinity.
It is important that rigorous regulations and particular techniques for the application of
efficient biofertilizers are developed in order to sustainably control abiotic stressors such as
drought and salt. Several investigations have established their effectiveness in improving
the growth and yield of crops under salinity and drought stress. Using natural resources
while stopping further degradation is one of the ways to meet the food requirements of
a growing society in a changing climate. Sustainable agriculture should cooperate with
the natural environment, using only solutions compatible with it, in order to be able to
mitigate the effects of a changing climate without risking even greater degradation [14].
Adaptation and mitigation to climate change are pose a challenge in agriculture nowadays
and in the near future. The use of stress-resistant PGPB may not only help in the fight
against the effects of abiotic stresses, but also lead to the mitigation of climate change, as a
result of discontinuing the use of some non-environmentally friendly solutions, such as
chemical fertilizer usage. The short storage and shelf-life of microbe-based formulations is
a significant constraint. The carrier material used to create a proper formulation is essential
in preserving microorganisms from harmful conditions during storage and transit, as
well as extending their shelf life. One of the causes for the microbial community’s poor
performance in natural conditions is a lack of knowledge about the suitable carrier in
conventional formulations (solid and liquid). According to some research, microencapsulation is a cutting-edge technique that may be utilized successfully to address these
disadvantages. In the future, more rigorous studies are required to evaluate their additive
effect on plant growth, and to study, at the molecular level, plant-microbe interaction
during multiple abiotic stressors under field conditions and to study the different carrier
materials for appropriate microbial formulation with longer shelf lives.
