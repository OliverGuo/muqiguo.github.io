Abstract
Calcium ­(Ca2+) signals are essential transducers and regulators in many adaptive and developmental processes in plants.
Protective responses of plants to a variety of environmental stress factors are mediated by transient changes of C
­ a2+ concentra2+
tion in plant cells. ­Ca ions are quickly transported by channel proteins present on the plasma membrane. During responses
to external stimuli, various signal molecules are transported directly from extracellular to intracellular compartments via
­Ca2+ channel proteins. Three types of ­Ca2+ channels have been identified in plant cell membranes: voltage-dependent
­Ca2+-permeable channels (VDCCs), which is sorted to depolarization-activated ­Ca2+-permeable channels (DACCs) and
hyperpolarization-activated ­Ca2+-permeable channels (HACCs), voltage-independent C
­ a2+-permeable channels (VICCs).
They make functions in the abiotic stress such as TPCs, CNGCs, MS channels, annexins which distribute in the organelles,
plasma membrane, mitochondria, cytosol, intracelluar membrane. This review summarizes recent advances in our knowledge
of many types of ­Ca2+ channels and ­Ca2+ signals involved in abiotic stress resistance and responses in plant cells.

Introduction
Plants are subject to numerous abiotic stress factors (including drought, salinity, high or low temperature, and hypoosmotic conditions) that suppress growth and may even
cause death. Accordingly, plants have evolved a variety of
physiological mechanisms (collectively termed “environmental adaptability”) to resist abiotic stress factors (Gilroy
and Trewavas 2001).
Calcium ­(Ca2+) functions as a second messenger in
many biotic activities. Signals are transmitted through ­Ca2+
conducting channels, and are able to sense and respond to
internal and environmental stimuli (Jammes et al. 2011).
In plants, these are essential mechanisms, and ­Ca2+ plays
an important role in resisting abiotic stress (Hepler 2005).

Intracellular ­Ca2+ is significant in signal transduction for
gene expression and cell cycle control (Berridge et al. 2003),
and is involved a variety of plant biological processes such
as light signaling (Harada et al. 2003), hormone responses
(Munemasa et al. 2007), cell growth (Frietsch et al. 2007),
stress and plant-pathogen interactions (Qi et al. 2010).
Two general categories of transfer systems for ­Ca2+ transport are found in plants: influx and efflux via channels and
carriers. ­Ca2+ channels are a type of transmembrane channel protein present on the surface of plant cells or organs
that transmit C
­ a2+ quickly and specifically. C
­ a2+ channels
are thus essential in transfer and regulation of C
­ a2+, which
is involved in all responses to abiotic stress. This review
describes recent research advances on C
­ a2+ channels and
their roles in abiotic stress response mechanisms.

Generation of ­Ca2+ signals
Plants have strong adaptive abilities to sense changes in their
surrounding environment and to regulate their growth and
development through appropriate responses to stimuli. To
induce expression of related genes, stress signals originating
outside the cell must cross the cell wall and reach the cell

interior. Under environmental stresses (e.g., drought, low
temperature, salinity), osmotic pressure at the cell membrane
increases (Boudsocq and Lauriere 2005), and this increase
is transmitted to membrane signal receptors. Activation
of ­Ca2+ channels by a series of phosphorylation reactions
results in C
­ a2+ influx, and increasing C
­ a2+ concentration
induces ­Ca2+ signals (Chinnusamy et al. 2004). The source
of quickly increasing C
­ a2+ is release from intracellular C
­ a2+
storage sites such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vacuoles. ­Ca2+ signals are essentially a type of chemical code,
and decoding is performed by ­Ca2+ sensors or decoders that
recognize changes in C
­ a2+ signals and are transferred into
the nucleus where genes are involved in transcription activity (Swarbreck et al. 2013). ­Ca2+ signals may also be generated automatically in plant cell nuclei. Nuclear ­Ca2+ signals
are linked to a variety of extranuclear signals, and provide
the best model for studies of symbiotic nuclear ­Ca2+ signals
(Charpentier and Oldroyd 2013).
After the plant perceives the stimulus, C
­ a2+ transport2+
ers regulate intracellular ­Ca concentration and produce
related ­Ca2+ signals. Intracellular ­Ca2+ concentration plays
essential roles in several aspects of plant growth, including cell division and organ formation (Zhang et al. 2014).
One classification system recognizes two types of C
­ a2+
2+
channel based on location: C
­ a influx channels in plasma
membrane, and ­Ca2+ releasing channels in intracellular
membranes. An alternative system recognizes (i) voltagedependent ­Ca2+-permeable channels (VDCCs), which are
subdivided into depolarization-activated ­Ca2+-permeable
channels (DACCs) and hyperpolarization-activated
­C a 2+-permeable channels (HACCs), and (ii) voltageindependent ­Ca2+-permeable channels (VICCs). H
­ +/Ca2+
2+
enzyme and C
­ a -ATP enzyme are the major components of
­Ca2+ transporters and C
­ a2+ pumps, which form transporting
systems for intracellular ­Ca2+ and maintain ­Ca2+ stability.

Influx ­Ca2+‑permeable channels in plasma
membrane
Elevated levels of intracellular or extracellular ­Ca2+ are
maintained by plasma membrane ­Ca2+-permeable channels
(Munaron et al. 2004). These influx channels are classified
into VDCCs and VICCs as described above. Intracellular
­Ca2+ may be accumulated by ­Ca2+ influx channels in plasma
membrane.

Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture (PCTOC) (2018) 132:413–424

Voltage‑dependent ­Ca2+‑permeable channels
(VDCCs)
VDCCs are subdivided into DACCs and HACCs as
described above, and in more detail below. Activation
of VDCCs is one mechanism whereby voltage pulses in
plasma membrane cause elevation of cytosolic C
­ a2+ level.
Depolarization‑activated ­Ca2+‑permeable channels (DACCs)
The first VDCCs discovered in plasma membrane were
DACCs (Thuleau et al. 1994). Depolarization on plasma
membrane is due to cation influx. Cell depolarization is
induced by low-temperature stress (White 2009). DACCs,
which open in response to low but above-freezing temperatures, are apparently present in plasma membranes of root
cells in all types of plants.
The existence of DACCs in carrot cell suspension was
demonstrated using patch-clamp technology (Thuleau
et al. 1994). DACCs were activated when plasma membrane was depolarized to − 135 mV, and they showed high
permeability to M
­ g2+, ­Sr2+ and ­Ba2+. This was the first
direct demonstration of VDCCs on plasma membrane in
higher plants. Similar VDCCs were subsequently found in
protoplasts of leaves, mesophyll, and roots of A. thaliana
(thale cress) (Piñeros and Tester 2011).
Two types of VDCCs were found in wheat: root C
­ a2+
channel (RCA channel) and Maxi-Cation channel (Piñeros
and Tester 1995). RCA channels are usually closed in dormant or normal wheat root cells. When cells are depolarized, RCA channels are activated, resulting in C
­ a 2+
influx. RCA channels were later shown to be sensitive
under certain conditions to 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs)
such as nifedipine, with increased opening rate of channels (Piñeros and Tester 2011). Maxi-Cation channels are
permselective to monatomic and divalent cations (e.g., ­K+,
­Na2+, ­Ca2+, ­Ba2+), and therefore have useful applications
in pharmacology. Cationic influx channels are inhibited
by ruthenium red, while efflux channels are inhibited by
ruthenium red, diltiazem, verapamil, quinine (Weiger and
Hermann 2014). Maxi-Cation channels are inhibited by
polyamines. Effects of C
­ a2+/H+ transport under polyamine treatment in pea roots were studied by microelectrode
technique, and ­Ca2+ activity was found to be coupled with
­H+ pump. ­H+ pump may inhibit accumulation of intracellular ­Ca2+ (Pottosin et al. 2014). Many other types of cation channels can be suppressed by polyamines, resulting
in plasma membrane depolarization. In contrast, reduction of polyamine level leads to increased cation channel
activation and hyperpolarization. A cooperative mechanism between ­Ca2+-dependent protein kinase 32 (CPK32)

and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 18 (CNGC18) was
responsible for increased depolarization of pollen tubes
and regulation of their growth (Zhou et al. 2014).
Hyperpolarization‑activated ­Ca2+‑permeable channels
(HACCs)
Hyperpolarization (the opposite of depolarization) refers to
an increase in potential difference (PD) relative to normal
transmembrane potential. Voltage PD across plasma membrane in plants is generally between − 120 and − 180 mV.
Hyperpolarization of plasma membrane may be caused
by ­H+ pump. HACCs are activated when PD falls below
− 120 mV, and the degree of activation depends on voltage
strength and duration. VDCCs activated by hyperpolarization were discovered in a sequential manner. Miedema et al.
(2008) showed that ­Ca2+ channel conductance is activated
by hyperpolarization in root cells of A. thaliana. On plasma
membrane of epidermal cells in onions, such channels are
involved in mechanical protection (Pickard and Ding 1993),
and enables depolarization of plasma membrane to prevent
water loss by initiating closure of stomata in guard cells
(Cosgrove and Hedrich 1991). HACCs is also a key component of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) in guard
cells (Jiao et al. 2013).
Annexins, a type of binding protein consisting of C
­ a2+,
phospholipids, and cytoskeleton, can also induce C
­ a2+
mobilization in HACCs. Annexins were first discovered in
higher plants (Boustead et al. 1989), and shown to affect cell
growth, development, adaptation, and responses to abiotic
stress. They are widely distributed in plants, and localized
in cytosol, plasma membrane, intracellular membranes, and
certain organelles. They play functional roles in exocytosis
and ­Ca2+ metabolism. Pharmacological experiments have
shown that annexins help regulate activities of non-selective
cation channels and ­Ca2+ influx channels. Annexin affected
transmembrane ­Ca2+ current in synthetic membrane only
under appropriate pH, and such current was highly sensitive
to ­Ca2+ inhibitor and ­Gd3+ (Laohavisit et al. 2009).

Voltage‑independent ­Ca2+‑permeable channels
(VICCs)
Phytohormones affect the permeability of ­Ca2+ channels.
Under drought stress, ABA acts synergistically with C
­ a2+ to
prevent stomatal opening and reduce water evaporation (Jiao
et al. 2013). ABA also helps regulate iron channel activation in plasma membrane, H
­ 2O2 production, and C
­ a2+ influx
2+
(Siegel et al. 2009). ­Ca permeability of plasma membrane
in coleoptile vesicular cells of corn was enhanced by the
phytohormone auxin, and appeared to be regulated by auxinbinding protein 1 (ABP1) (Kirpichnikova et al. 2014).

Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) associated with ­Ca2+ signaling play roles in plant physiological processes such as plant growth, thermotolerance, and
in responses to biotic and abiotic stress factors (Gao et al.
2012). The genome of A. thaliana includes ~ 20 CNGCencoding genes (Jha et al. 2016). Because of difficulty in
isolating CNGC mutants, it remains unclear which CNGCs
are involved in which processes (Table 1).
The 20 CNGCs can be divided into five subfamilies.
CNGCs 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, and 18 are involved
mainly in plant growth (Frietsch et al. 2007). CNGCs
1, 2, 3, 10, 19, and 20 are involved in stress responses
(Kugler et al. 2009). CNGCs 1, 2 mainly influence the
metal toxicity and the others are mainly related to the salt
stress. CNGCs 2, 4, 11, and 12 are involved in immunity (Dietrich et al. 2010). The AtCNGC2 mutant dnd1
(defense no death) belongs to immune phenotype, and the
A. thaliana mutant rdd1 (repressor of defense no death 1)
inhibited most dnd1 phenotypes. Genetic analysis revealed
involvement of rdd1 in AtCNGC4 signal transduction,
and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis
showed the presence of AtCNGC2 and AtCNGC4 in the
same pathway (Chin et al. 2013). The existence of nonselective ­Ca2+ channels encoded by CNGC5 and CNGC6
in A. thaliana guard cells was demonstrated by overexpression experiments. Guard cells of CNGC5 and CNGC6
mutants displayed harmful effects on electricity activated
by cGMP and show synergistically with ABA (Wang
et al. 2013). CNGC6 is discovered to be mediated heatinduced ­Ca2+ influx and related to the heat shock (HSP)
genes in A. thaliana. Gao (2012) showed the activation
of the C
­ a2+ channel could increase the concentration of
cytosolic cAMP and then downstream expression of the
HSP gene to the heat shock response. CNGC12 interacts
with the ­Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) via combination
of an IQ-motif channel with the CaM C-terminus. At the
N-terminal binding site of CNGC12, ­Ca2+/CaM plays a
regulatory role through negative feedback (Defalco et al.
2016a, b). Shih (2015) found that CNGC14 played a role
in the auxin-induced ­Ca2+ signaling pathway controlled
by gravitropism in roots. Charpentier et al. (2016) showed
that ­Ca2+ spiking in Medicago truncatula was controlled
by three CNGC15 homologs (Mt-CNGC15a, -b, -c) acting as channels in nuclear membrane, and ­Ca2+ could not
cross the membrane when these homologs were knocked
down. ­K+ is maintained by CNGC15 through its interaction with K
­ + channel during C
­ a 2+ spiking in the membrane (Capoen et al. 2011). By quantitative PCR analysis
of pollen, Tune-Ozdemir (2013) showed expression of
heat-resistance genes in a CNGC16 mutant. Pollen feasibility analysis indicated that the mutant pollen was highly
sensitive to C
­ a2+, and that thermotolerance was enhanced
by the pollen through cyclic nucleotide signals, ­C a 2+

CNGC17 forms compounds with the leucine-rich repeat
receptor-like protein kinase co-receptor BAK1, members
of the A. thaliana ­H+-ATPase family of proton pumps, and
the phytosulfokine receptor PSKR1 (Ladwig et al. 2015).
CNGC18 is one of the isoforms related to ­Ca2+ channels;
it helps regulate pollen tube guidance and interacts with
calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK32) (Zhou et al.
2014). In Xenopus oocytes, CNGC18 was activated following co-expression of CPK32 (Zhou et al. 2014), indicating that CNGCs are involved in C
­ a2+ channel function
(Gao et al. 2016). However, the mechanisms of CNGC
distribution remain unclear. A proposal that CNGCs are
distributed only on plasma membrane was shown to be
incorrect. Mt-CNGC15a/b/c is distributed in the nucleus,
and controls ­Ca2+ store flux in the nuclear envelope lumen
and to ER (Yuen and Christopher 2013). Many CNGCs
have putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences,
including isoforms located in plasma membrane (Charpentier et al. 2016; Fischer et al. 2013). Among the 21 CNGCs
in M. truncatula, 14 types in DMI1 (Capoen et al. 2011)
and CASTOR (Charpentier et al. 2008) are predicted to
contain NLS motifs. It remains to be determined whether

CNGC distribution is dynamic in the face of differing cellular stimuli.
Besides A. thaliana, CNGCs are also distributed in other
kinds of species which are discovered by the bioinformatics
analyses. There are total 16 CNGCs genes in Oryza sativa L.
expanded through chromosomal segmentation. The family
of OsCNGCs could be divided into four major groups and
two sub-groups (Nawaz et al. 2014); Physcomitrella contains
eight CNGC homologues, four of which are clustered with
the AtCNGCs including AtCNGC2, AtCNGC4 and AtCNGC19, indicating that there may be a conserved function
between mosses and angio-sperms (Verret et al. 2010). In
the important crop tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., there
are 18 CNGC genes. SlCNGC genes make sense in the disease resistance and ­Ca2+ signaling. They silenced these SlCNGCs genes and found the changes in the expression of the
­Ca2+ signaling genes. Thus they made a conclusion that the
regulation of the resistance may be related to the affecting
of the ­Ca2+ signaling (Saand et al. 2015). In pear (Pyrus
bretchneideri Rehd.), there are 21 CNGC genes which could
be divided into five groups. Group 1 has the most motifs in
all CNGCs groups including 26 motifs. Among all kinds
of motifs, there are 8 motifs existing all kinds of group

indicating the conservative part of the CNGC family (Chen
et al. 2015).
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) present in the surrounding environment are the basis of an important index that
reflects damage and defensive responses in plants under
stress. ROS are related to levels of polyamines and ABA
(Alcazar et al. 2010), which produce nitric oxide (NO) and
regulate opening and equilibrium of ­Ca2+ channels. NO
and ­Ca2+ are essential parts of signal cascades related to
aging in plants, but interaction between these two components during the aging process remains unclear (Ma et al.
2010). Associations between ROS and ­Ca2+ are involved in
cell–cell communication and long-distance delivery (Steinhorst and Kudla 2013). ROS function as a second messenger
to activate anion channels during sensing and guard cells
signaling. Anion channels distributed on plasma membrane
are activated by anion fluxes via voltage-gated ­K+ transport
channels (Murata et al. 2015), ABA (Roelfsema et al. 2012),
and NADPH (Leterrier et al. 2016). Damage by ROS can
be reduced by antioxidant enzymes through inhibition of
phospholipase C (PLC) activity and blocking of C
­ a2+ signaling pathways in cells (Domijan et al. 2014). PLC is also
involved in responses to lipopolysaccharide stress. Treatment of cultured plant cells with 20 µM U73122 (a PLC
inhibitor) inhibited stress response and greatly increased
­Ca2+ signals relative to negative control. Ranf et al. (2015)
recently discovered lectin S-domain receptor kinase, characterized as a receptor in lipopolysaccharide stress response.

Ca2+ releasing channels in intracellular
membranes
Ca2+ channels located in chloroplasts
Chloroplasts have a bilayer structure and contain chlorophyll
used for photosynthesis. The chloroplast stroma includes
numerous thylakoids comprised of a membranous capsule
and containing DNA. Pottosin and Schönknecht (1996) studied ­Ca2+ currents generated by opening of VDCCs. Such
­Ca2+ channels had electrical conductivity higher than that
of monovalent cation channels, but showed greater selectivity for divalent than for monovalent cations. Opening of
the channels was enhanced when chloroplasts had greater
positive charge in the stroma than inside the thylakoids.
This type of channel controls exchanges between thylakoids
and chloroplast, but its involvement in signal transduction
is unclear. Chloroplasts produce immune signaling molecules such as salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, and are thus
involved in plant immune responses. The molecular mechanisms of nuclear immune signaling to chloroplasts and mitochondria are unknown. Specific ­Ca2+ signals may be triggered by chloroplasts or mitochondria in response to biotic

or abiotic stress (Nomura and Shiina 2014). ­Ca2+ absorbance
can be inhibited by light stimulation and by ruthenium red.
Recognition of ­Ca2+ transporters and the presence of signals
indicate that ­Ca2+ functions not only in the cell interior, but
also in plant immune responses and responses to external
stress factors.
Proteins such as calcium-sensing receptor (CAS) are
present in chloroplasts and can be transferred to the stroma
to reduce specific ­Ca2+ signals via the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) pathway. This pathway is
involved in ­Ca2+ transfer and in death of sensitive cells
mediated by R genes (Nomura et al. 2013). CAS also makes
functions in the photoacclimation in Chlamydomonas proved
by the knockdown species (Petroutsos et al. 2011). AtCAS
makes sense in the stomatal closure related to the concentration of ­Ca2+ (Han et al. 2003).

Ca2+ channels located in tonoplasts
The vacuole occupies > 90% of the space in a plant cell,
and contains the major C
­ a2+ store and source of C
­ a2+ for
cell signaling (Pottosin and Schönknecht 2007). The electrochemical gradient of C
­ a2+ across the tonoplast (membrane
that surrounds the vacuole) is very large. Channels that react
to ­Ca2+ stimulating factors are distributed in tonoplast. C
­ a2+
concentration is regulated through release or uptake of ­Ca2+
stimulated by low temperature. Slow vacuolar (SV) channels, encoded by two-pore channel 1 (TPC1), were detected
by fura-2 fluorescence measurements and patch-clamp technique (Peiter et al. 2005) in carrot root vacuoles (Gradogna
et al. 2009). AtTPC1 make in sense in homestasis more than
signalling to stress (Stael et al. 2012).
Certain types of C
­ a2+ channels coexist in tonoplasts.
DACCs and VDCCs such as SV channels are selective for
divalent cations, but their physiological functions remain
unclear. The SV channel encoded by TPC1 is characterized
by slow inactivation and activation, and its function is controversial because of its complicated mechanism and low
cation selectivity (Peiter 2011). In the cytoplasm of guard
cells of Vicia faba (fava bean), increase of ­Ca2+ concentration activates an SV channel present in tonoplast and results
in ­Ca2+ efflux, a depolarizing reaction that leads to further
opening of the SV channel. This phenomenon was proposed
to be a positive feedback mechanism resulting from ­Ca2+
oscillation and “calcium-induced calcium release” (Laver
et al. 2013).
Ca 2+ DACCs in tonoplasts of suspension-cultured
tobacco cells were described in the 1990s. Such channels
were blocked by C
­ d2+ at various concentrations, but were
not sensitive to ­Ni2+, ­La3+, ­Gd3+, verapamil, or nifedipine at
the same concentrations for which sensitivity to B
­ a2+, ­Sr2+,
2+
2+
­Ca , or ­Mg was observed (Ping et al. 1992). Electrical

conductivity was 19 pS under 50 mmol/L ­Ca2+, and 30 pS
under 50 mmol/L ­Ba2+.
DACCs may be involved in signaling pathways that are
selective for divalent cations and promote C
­ a2+ influx into
2+
cytoplasm. Several C
­ a channels present in tonoplast are
activated by second messengers such as ­IP3 and cyclic ADP
ribose (cADPR). ­Ca2+ release is promoted by ­IP3 in vacuoles
of Beta vulgaris (beet), indicating the presence of ­Ca2+ channels (Schönknecht 2013).

Ca2+ channels located in lysosomes
Mucolipin transient receptor potential (TRP) channels
(termed TRPML1, -2, -3) are the basic C
­ a2+ channels in
lysosomes. TRPML1 is a key regulator of most lysosomal
trafficking processes (Li et al. 2013; Cheng et al. 2010),
which are localized in late endosome or lysosome (Venkatachalam et al. 2015). Regulation of TRPML1 by PI(3,5)P2
is an example of compartment-specific regulation of organellar channels.
Two-pore channels (TPCs) are found only in acidic organelles and lysosomes that have protective functions (Morgan
and Galione 2014). Induction of ­Ca2+ release by nicotinic
acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is partially
based on overexpression of TPCs (Parrington and Tunn
2014; Calcraft et al. 2009), though a specific relationship
between TPCs and NAADP has not been conclusively demonstrated. TPC1 is activated by the dimerization of the a
predicted helix within the carboxyl-terminus (CTH), this
indicates the TPC1 depends on the C-terminal dimerization
(Larisch et al. 2016).

Ca2+ channels located in ER
Ca2+ channels distributed in ER are also present (but less
well known) in various plant species.. Bryonia calcium
channel 1 (BCC1) was described in ER of tendril tissues
in Bryonia dioica (a climbing vine). Opening of BCC1 is
controlled by ­Ca2+ concentration, which is regulated by
­Ca2+-ATPase in ER. BCC1 may play a key role in ­Ca2+
signal delivery via sensing/signaling pathways in higher
plants (Klusener et al. 1995) belonging to voltage-gated
rectifier channel. LCC1 (Lepidium calcium channel 1) is a
­Ca2+ channel which is voltage gated and strongly rectifying
existing in the ER of root cells discoveried by the technology
of planar lipid bilayer in Lepidium sativum (garden cress; a
cruciferous plant). BCC1 and LCC1 are highly selective and
voltage-dependent ­Ca2+ channels whose activity is promoted
by ­Ba2+, ­Sr2+, and M
­ g2+, and inhibited by L
­ a3+ and G
­ d3+
2+
(Klusener and Weiler 1999). ­Ca flux from ER is closely
related to cell signaling. C
­ a2+ release appears to be associated with ER levels of cADPR, NAADP, and ­IP3, but direct
evidence for such association is needed.

Ca2+ channels located in mitochondria
Ca2+ efflux is mediated by ­Na+-dependent (mitoNCX) and
­Na+-independent ­Ca2+ transporters. In an A. thaliana model,
six MCU genes with low homoloogy to the human. are conserved and have been identified as putative MCU channel
proteins. They and their human MCU homologs share a
pore-loop domain, transmembrane domains, and conserved
DVME (Asp-Val-Met-Glu) signature sequence (Stael et al.
2012). AtMCU1 activity is sensitive to the MCU inhibitors
ruthenium red and G
­ d3+, and to A. thaliana protein MICU,
a regulatory MCUC component. AtMCU1 is expressed
mainly in root cells and is localized in mitochondria. Its
absence results in moderate changes in ­Ca2+ dynamics, as
assessed by in vivo measurements in root tips. Under restrictive growth conditions, knockdown or overexpression of
AtMCU1 results in altered ultrastructure of root mitochondria and shortening of primary roots (Teardo et al. 2016).

Ca2+ channels related to abiotic stress
resistance
Changes in ­Ca2+ concentration and in forms of protein
phosphorylation including mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) cascades in plant cells may result from biotic and
abiotic stress signals. Cytoplasmic ­Ca2+ concentration is the
first to respond to all types of stress stimuli, and changes
are quickly mediated via ­Ca2+ channels and other media
to reach sensory elements in cells and thereby extend the
stress signals (Kudla et al. 2010). ­Ca2+-dependent protein
kinases (CDPKs) are involved in the signal transduction
under the stress. Among all CDPK genes, the expression of
VaCPK21 is significantly up-regulated in Vitis amurensis
which is probably to be acted as a positive regulator under
the salt and high temperature stress (Dubrovina et al. 2016).
VaCPK1 and VaCPK21 are also related to the stilbene
synthesis contributing to the plant biotic stress resistance
(Aleynova et al. 2017). ­Ca2+ concentration was monitored
by fluorescence signals in cells of A. thaliana, which have an
aequorin expressing system; signals were emitted by germinating seedlings within 5 s after exposure to exogenous NaCl
or mannitol, reaching a maximal level within 10 s (Knight
et al. 1997). The appearance of these fluorescence signals
in such a short time illustrates the ability of C
­ a2+-channel
proteins distributed on the cell membrane to respond very
quickly to stress, resulting in ­Ca2+ influx and transduction of
a series of signals. In Populus euphratica, heat shock (HS)
could induce an early influx of C
­ a2+ and K
­ +. ­GdCl3 acts
as an inhibitor to decrease the H
­ 2O2, indicating that the P.
euphratica probably resists the HS through the enhancement
of the antioxidant system (Yu et al. 2016). Discovery and
functional characterization of stress-related ­Ca2+ channels

has lagged behind that of K
­ + channels (Lan et al. 2011; Very
and; Sentenac 2002; Hirsch et al. 1998) which have been
cloned and more intensively studied (Table 2).
ABA, ethylene, auxin, and I­ P3 are known to regulate plant
growth and signaling in response to environmental stresses
through complex signal transduction and metabolic processes. However, relationships between abiotic stress factors and resulting plant signals are unclear in many cases.

Role of two‑pore channels (TPCs) in abiotic stress
resistance
Two-pore channels comprise a subfamily of the eukaryotic voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) superfamily that
are mainly expressed in acidic stores in plants(Sandra et al.
2017), which comprise a large family of intracellular cation
channels that are expressed only in acid organelles and vacuoles. The names applied to TPCs differ depending on the
species of plant. OsTPC1, AtTPC1, and TaTPC1 are typical
TPCs described in rice, guard cells, and wheat.
OsTPC1, a voltage-gated ­Ca2+ channel found in rice, has
a function similar to that of its homolog AtTPC1. Hamada
et al. (2012) showed that OsTPC1 plays an essential role
in hypersensitive cell death induced by TvX. Persistent
increase of C
­ a2+ induced by TvX is mediated by OsTPC1

as ­Ca2+ channel. OsTPC1 is also involved in synthesis of
phytoalexins, a type of antimicrobial substance.
In some cases, a particular signal transduction pathway
may be involved in responses to multiple types of stress,
which are difficult to distinguish because resistance to them
depends on the same action. AtTPC1 is the most studied (to
date) protein that functions in response to multiple stress
factors. AtTPC1 is an SV C
­ a2+ TPC involved in stomatal
closure in guard cells. AtTPC1 can compensate for cch1
mutation in yeast, and restores ­Ca2+ function to enhance
tolerance of sugar stress (Hashimoto et al. 2004). In studies
of AtTPC1 mutant attpc 1–2, exogenous C
­ a2+ treatment did
not induce stomatal closure nor activate anionic channels to
produce current. AtTPC1 existing in guard cell stomata evidently responds to exogenous C
­ a2+ signals and participates
in both anionic channel opening and stomatal closure, but
is not regulated by ABA or methyl jasmonate (Islam et al.
2010). Transmission systems based on fast C
­ a2+ waves can
2+
resist stress, and C
­ a speed may reach 420 µm/s (Choi et al.
2014). In A. thaliana root tissue subjected to salinity stress,
­Ca2+ spreads through AtTPC1, a ­Ca2+ channel, existing in
the cortex and endodermis. Waves in the C
­ a2+/TPC1 system
may involve specific molecular reactions induced by salinity
stress (Choi et al. 2014).
TaTPC1, a C
­ a2+ channel found in wheat, is induced by
high salinity, polyethylene glycol, low temperature, or ABA

(Wang et al. 2005). In complementation experiments, a yeast
cch1 mutant survived under L
­ i+ ion stress when TaTPC1 was
expressed. Stomatal closure ability was higher in TaTPC1overexpressing plants (Wang et al. 2005). The above findings all indicate the involvement of ­Ca2+ in responses to
environmental changes.

Role of cyclic nucleotide‑gated channels (CNGCs)
in abiotic stress resistance
The CNGCs are ligand-gated cation channels localized
mostly in the plasma membrane belonging to the VICCs.
Members of the CNGC family in A. thaliana are involved in
ion signal transduction through ­Ca2+ flow, and in responses
to biotic and abiotic stress factors.
Tune-Ozdemir (2013) demonstrated expression of heatresistance genes in a CNGC16 mutant of A. thaliana by
quantitative PCR analysis. Pollen feasibility analysis showed
that pollen of the mutant was highly sensitive to C
­ a2+, and
that thermotolerance was induced by pollen through cyclic
nucleotide signals, C
­ a2+ channels, and a signal network.
CGNC16 was responsive to high temperature and drought,
whereas a cgnc16 mutant was sensitive to exogenous C
­ aCl2
(Tune-Ozdemir et al. 2013). In rice, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in COLD1 (a G protein) enhanced cold tolerance
through rapid ­Ca2+ flow, suggesting that CNGCs may be
complexed with COLD1 (Ma et al. 2015). In A. thaliana pollen and leaf cells, high temperature stress results in a sharp
rise of cGMP concentration and greatly reduced expression
of heat stress response genes, including those encoding heat
shock transcription factors such as HsfA2 and HsfB1. Thus,
CGNC16 appears to be a permeability channel involved in
cyclic nucleotide signaling responses to high temperature
and drought.
CNGC19 and CNGC20 play a role in responses to salinity
stress (Kugler et al. 2009). Expression of these two genes
is upregulated in response to increased salinity stress, but
is unaffected by mannitol stress. Under various durations
(6–72 h) of salinity stress, there was a strong response by
CNGC19 in buds, but no response by CNGC19 in roots.
CGNC20 expression increased greatly after 1 h of salinity
stress.

Role of ­Ca2+‑permeable mechanosensitive (MS)
channels in abiotic stress resistance
Ca2+-permeable MS channels are able to sense mechanical stimuli. In Escherichia coli, hypo-osmotic shock is an
activator for increase of cytoplasmic C
­ a2+ concentration,
2+
mainly by ­Ca influx through plasma membrane (Nakagawa et al. 2007; Kurusu et al. 2012). MscS, one of three
types of MS channels, helps prevent rupturing of cells
under hypo-osmotic stress (Hurst et al. 2008). MscS-like

channels (MSLs), a kind of nonselective channel, are present
in plants and algae, which can be divided into two types:
class I (localized in mitochondria and having plastids with
target sequences) and class II (lacking plastids). The A. thaliana genome includes ten MSL genes: MSL1-3 (class I) and
MSL4-10 (class II). The eukaryotic MscS members, especially MSL2 and MSL3 existing in the chloroplast make a
great significant in the various physiological functions such
as chloroplast division, plastid size, shape (Wilson et al.
2011; Haswell and Meyerowitz 2006). They contain a C-terminal cytoplasmic conserved domain (Jensen and Haswell
2012), which is necessary for the proper channel functions
and subcellular localization. Class II such as MSL10, is distinguished with 6 TM regions with large soluble N- and
C-termini, also has a large cytoplasmic loop between TM
helix 4 and 5 (Haswell 2007; Nakayama et al. 2012), which
is the basic of specific functions in the eukaryote such as
controlling and sensing the C
­ a2+ influx including hypoosmotic stress (Nakayama et al. 2012).

Role of annexins in abiotic stress resistance
Annexins are a type of C
­ a2+ channel belonging to HACCs
involved in drought stress tolerance in plants. AtANN1 is
an annexin found in A. thaliana. In a study by KonopkaPostupolska et al. (2009), A. thaliana was treated by short
photoperiod for 4 weeks, and then by drought stress until
complete dehydration. An atann1 deletion mutant died by
day 5, whereas wild-type and an AtANN1-overexpressing
mutant remained green, illustrating the role of annexins in
drought stress resistance.

Future prospects
The environment of plants contains a variety of physical
and chemical stimuli, and the associated signal transduction
pathways involve many types of ­Ca2+ channels. Research
on plant ­Ca2+ channels has undergone important, sequential
advances during the past decade. Continued development
of patch-clamp technology, calcium imaging systems, and
related methods will lead to discovery and elucidation of
more ­Ca2+ channels.
Ca2+ concentrations resulting from various plant cell
stimuli display differences in range, duration, and spatial
distribution that are associated with specific reactions.
­Ca2+ signals are one of the most important signal types that
regulate plant homeostasis and growth. Research on ­Ca2+
channels and C
­ a2+ signals is essential to clarify the mechanisms of plant tolerance/resistance to all types of abiotic
and biotic stress, and is becoming increasingly popular
in our field. Studies on stress-related physiological modifications are well advanced, but the associated molecular

modifications remain poorly known. There is an exciting
future for studies on identification of stress-related proteins
and use of transgenesis techniques to enhance stress resistance in plants.
