month differ across years because of changing cost-sharing limits, but not because of patients’ responses to changing cost-sharing
limits or because of different responses to prices in years with a deductible and in years with a no-claim refund.
Formally, for the instrument 𝑧𝑖𝑡 to be valid, we need it to be relevant and an exclusion restriction needs to hold. As for relevance,
𝑧𝑖𝑡 is related to 𝑝𝑖𝑡 by design. In Section 8.1 below, we document that the first stage 𝐹 -statistic is very high. The exclusion restriction
is that
𝔼[𝜀𝑖𝑡|𝑧𝑖𝑡, 𝑥𝑖𝑡
] = 𝔼[𝜀𝑖𝑡|𝑥𝑖𝑡
],
which means that conditional on year and month dummies, age, gender, risk score, future price in January, and expenditures in the
previous 3 months, the simulated fraction of individuals without cost-sharing is mean independent of 𝜀𝑖𝑡. This restriction is likely to
hold because of the way we construct our instrument.29
This can be seen by re-visiting the three threats to identification we have discussed in Section 5.1: omitted variable bias, auto-
correlation in error terms, and seasonal trends that differ between groups in the population. In contrast to individual prices 𝑝𝑖𝑡, our
instrumental variable 𝑧𝑖𝑡 only varies at the group level. It is therefore unrelated to omitted variables capturing individual differences
within the group (recall that we control for differences across groups by controlling for 𝑥𝑖𝑡). For the same reason, it is also unrelated
to past values of the error term at the individual level. Related to the third threat, by drawing from the empirical distribution function
that was estimated from the pooled data our instrumental variables are unrelated to seasonal trends at the group level.
Throughout, reported standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered at the level of groups defined by the risk score
decile, three age categories, gender, and year. In our definition of clusters we follow the level of variation in our instrumental variable.
The empirical approach we take in this paper is new in the context of studying the effects of patient cost-sharing. It combines the
idea of exploiting variation within years and across groups, as suggested by Ellis et al. (2017), who use average prices for different
health insurance plans as instruments, with the idea of constructing an instrument by combining draws from an empirical distribution
function in combination with knowledge about variation in institutional rules, which was used in other settings for example by Currie
and Gruber (1996a,b) and Cutler and Gruber (1996).
Our simulated instrumental variables approach can be seen as a generalization of a triple differences-in-differences grouping
estimator. The first difference is within groups and year and across months; the second difference is across groups; and the third
difference is across policy regimes. For illustration, suppose that there are only two groups and two points in time within the same year,
and that for both groups the average price changes between the two points in time, but by a different amount. Then the instrumental
variable estimator relates the difference in the change in spending between the two groups to the difference in the change in prices,
also controlling for seasonal variation common to the two groups. This is akin to a differences-in-differences estimator within the year.
The third difference comes from comparing estimates of price effects for years when the no-claim refund was in place to estimates
for years when a deductible was in place.
6. Results
6.1. Main results
We now turn to our results. If patients respond more strongly to cost-sharing incentives when they are framed as a deductible than
when they are framed as a no-claim refund, then the coefficient on the current price interacted with an indicator for the deductible
regime will be more negative than the coefficient on the current price interacted with an indicator for the no-claim regime.
Our main results are shown in Table 2. The dependent variable in column (1) is the log of expenditures plus one.30 Therefore,
reported coefficients are (approximately) percentage changes.31 We find the price effect to be a 16.9 percent decrease in expenditures
under a no-claim refund and a 38.7 percent decrease under a deductible. This implies that under a no-claim refund individuals spend
16.9 percent less on health care in months before hitting the no-claim refund limit than in months after hitting the no-claim refund
limit. Correspondingly, under a deductible individuals spend 38.7 percent less on health care in months before hitting the deductible
limit than in months after hitting the deductible limit. While these estimates might seem large, our estimate for the effect of deductibles
is similar and even somewhat smaller compared to the one of Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017), who find a price effect of deductibles on
monthly health care expenditures of 42.2 percent for a sample of highly paid employees of a large American firm.
The last row of the table shows the 𝑝-value for a test of the null hypothesis that the two price effects are equal. This null hypothesis
is rejected, confirming that individuals react stronger to prices under a deductible policy than under a no-claim refund policy.
29 Strictly speaking, a possible violation of the exclusion restriction comes from the fact that when estimating the empirical distribution function
of monthly health care consumption, then we also use observations for individual 𝑖. Formally, the instrument is therefore a function of the error
terms of individual 𝑖. However, the impact thereof will vanish in the limit, when the number of observations goes to infinity. We are not concerned
about this because of the large number of observations. On average, there are about 170,000 observations for each group in our estimation sample
and the smallest group has 44,388 observations. In principle, one could construct the instrument at the individual level by estimating the empirical
distribution function using data from all other individuals, but this would substantially increase the computational burden (by a factor 𝑁, where 𝑁
is the number of individuals). We have experimented with this for a small number of individuals and have found that it did not noticeably affect
the estimates of the empirical distribution function. Therefore, we have not implemented this for the full sample.
30 In Table C.4 below we show that adding 10 or 0.1, respectively, leads to different point estimates but the same qualitative findings.
31 Recall that we use the log of expenditures plus 1 as the dependent variable. The exact percentage change of the dependent variable associated
with a coefficient of −0.169 on the current price in the no-claim regime is 𝑒−0.169 − 1 = −0.155. In the following, we will abstract from such small
differences.

In column (2), the dependent variable is an indicator for having a claim. Hence, reported coefficients show price effects at the
extensive margin. The price effect is a 4.8 percentage point decrease in the probability to have a claim in a given month under the
no-claim regime and a 7.4 percentage point decrease under the deductible. The difference is statistically different from zero at the 5
percent level.
6.2. Effect heterogeneity
Next, we characterize effect heterogeneity. We do so to investigate whether the average effects we estimate are driven by particular
groups or whether framing has an effect across all groups. For this we leverage the fact that our sample is for a broad sample of the
population and that we observe background variables such as income in the neighborhood.
Our general approach to characterize effect heterogeneity is to split the sample.32 We start with investigating whether price
effects and the impact of framing differ by income. We divide individuals in 4 groups, according to the average income at the 6-digit
neighborhood level, where quartile 1 refers to the group with the lowest income. A 6-digit postal code has on average 37 residents
(footnote 16). Table 3 shows that that individuals in poorer neighborhoods do not react more strongly to cost-sharing incentives
32 Here and in the following we present results for the effect on expenditures. Results for the extensive margin (having at least one claim in a given
month) are presented in Online Appendix C.

than individuals in richer neighborhoods. Results for each of the income groups are similar to the baseline results, and there are
no systematic differences across groups, with the exemption that individuals in the lowest income quartile react less strongly to
cost-sharing incentives under the no-claim refund. Furthermore, within each group the price effect is significantly stronger under
a deductible scheme than under a no-claim refund scheme. Yet, the difference between the price effects under a deductible and a
no-claim refund is larger for individuals in low income neighborhoods.
Table 4 shows results by age and gender. Individuals in all age and gender groups react stronger to deductibles than to no-claim
refunds. Moreover, price responses are similar for persons above age 65 and for persons below age 65. This is an interesting result
since many previous studies on the effects of patient cost-sharing examine either the working age population or people above age
65, e.g. Medicare beneficiaries. In the Netherlands, individuals buy the same type of health insurance below and above age 65, and
insurance coverage does not change discontinuously at age 65, as it does for instance in the U.S. (Card et al., 2008). However, we
find differences in price effects on expenditures by gender. Women react stronger to cost-sharing incentives than men, both under a
deductible and a no-claim refund.
Next, we split the sample by risk score. The idea behind this is that we expect individuals with a higher risk score to react less
strongly to price changes. About 80 percent of the individuals with an above-median risk score will exhaust the deductible or no-claim
refund limit by the end of the year, while this is the case for only about 20–30 percent of the individuals with a below-median risk
score. Therefore, one might expect below-median risk score individuals to react more strongly to hitting the cost-sharing limit, as it
is a priori less likely that they do (see Section 3). Table 5 is in line with this prediction. We find that the price effect for individuals
with below-median risk scores is generally stronger than for individuals with above-median risk scores. Furthermore, we find that

the difference between the price effects under a deductible and a no-claim refund is larger for individuals with a high risk score, and
this difference is very small and not statistically significant for individuals with a low risk score.
6.3. The effect of framing on annual health care expenditures
Our main results so far are that no-claim refunds and deductibles reduce monthly health care expenditures by 16.9 percent and
38.7 percent, respectively, in months in which patients are still subject to cost-sharing. Yet, these numbers are not indicative for the
effects of no-claim refunds and deductibles on annual health care expenditures since cost-sharing incentives apply only for months
in which cost-sharing limits are not yet exceeded. In this section we aim to compute the effect of no-claim refunds and deductibles
on annual health care expenditures and on annual out-of-pocket spending.
For this, we conduct a simulation study. In a first step, we calculate the residuals and estimate their empirical distribution function.
Then, we take our estimation equation and a current price of 1 at the beginning of January as a starting point and simulate, for each
individual in our data set, health care expenditures in January by calculating the predicted mean of the log of health care expenditures
plus one, according to equation (1), and adding a draw from the empirical distribution function of the residual. This is then transformed
into actual health care expenditures by applying the exponential function and subtracting 1. Next, we calculate simulated prices for
all individuals at the beginning of February, again predict the mean of the log of health care spending plus one given those prices,
and so on. We do so for 2015 and both the case in which cost-sharing incentives are framed as a deductible, as it was the case in
2015, and for the case in which cost-sharing incentives are framed as a no-claim refund. For the latter, we use 𝛽no-claim refund instead
of 𝛽deductible.
Fig. 3 shows the result. On average, annual health care expenditures are 8.6 percent lower when cost-sharing incentives are framed
as a deductible than when they are framed as a no-claim refund. In absolute terms, annual health care expenditures decrease more
for higher risk score deciles. In relative terms, annual care expenditures decrease more for lower risk-score deciles. The underlying
mechanism is that low risk-score individuals tend to exceed cost-sharing limits later in the year or not at all, and they are thus subject
to cost-sharing incentives for a longer period than high risk-score individuals.
Turning to the effect of the framing of cost-sharing incentives on out-of-pocket spending, we find that it follows a U-shaped pattern.
The effect is lowest for individuals with a high risk score. For individuals who exceed the cost-sharing limit under both cost-sharing
schemes there is no difference in out-of-pocket spending between the two schemes. The effect is also small for individuals with the
lowest risk-scores. These individuals have low health care expenditures and low out-of-pocket spending under both schemes. The
effect of framing on out-of-pocket spending is largest for individuals in risk-score deciles 5 and 6.
Overall, it is striking that changing the framing of cost-sharing incentives leads to large effects on health care spending—a reduction
of 207.97 euros per year on average—, while having very modest effects—a reduction of 10.06 euros on average—on out-of-pocket
expenditures.
7. Potential mechanisms
In the previous section we have shown that individuals react more strongly to financial incentives in years in which they are framed
as a deductible than in years in which they are framed as a no-claim refund. In this section, we present possible explanations for our
findings, including loss aversion, time discounting, liquidity constraints, differences in information, and salience. We conclude that
loss aversion is our preferred explanation, but we cannot completely rule out other explanations such as time discounting, liquidity
constraints, and salience.

Fig. 4. Experienced effects Notes: This figure shows the experienced effects of a foregone refund and of a deductible payment. The amount for both
is the same..
7.1. Loss aversion
Loss aversion, one of the elements of prospect theory, postulates that decision-makers value losses more than corresponding gains
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). This concept can also be applied to patient cost-sharing for health insurance where cost-sharing
incentives can be perceived either as a loss or a gain. Whether patients perceive payments as a loss or a gain depends on their
reference point.
In a theoretical contribution, Johnson et al. (1993) consider the case when patients perceive their financial situation after paying
insurance premiums as reference point.33 Compared to this reference point they will view a deductible payment as a loss. In contrast,
if they receive a refund at the end of the year under a no-claim refund policy, then they will view this payment as a gain relative
to their reference point. Thus, patients should react stronger to cost-sharing under a deductible policy than under a no-claim refund
policy.
This is illustrated in Fig. 4, which shows a utility curve (“value”) under loss aversion when the cost-sharing limit has not been
reached. The reference point is the financial situation after paying health insurance premiums. The utility curve is steeper to the left
than to the right of the cutoff point, and in both directions the utility curve becomes flatter with increasing distance to the reference
point. The figure shows that the experienced effect of a deductible payment is higher than the effect of an equivalent reduction in
the refund under a no-claim refund policy. When patients make decisions about medical care use they will compare the value of the
treatment with the value they assign to their own payment, either a deductible payment or a foregone refund under a no-claim refund
policy. Thus, patients will use less medical care under a deductible policy than under a no-claim refund policy.34
Above, we have assumed that patients perceive the financial situation after paying health insurance premiums as their reference
point. However, van Winssen et al. (2016) point out that individuals may also have other reference points such as their financial
situation before paying insurance premiums. In that case, they will feel to be in the loss domain under both schemes. Then, there will
be no stronger response to the price under a deductible than under a no-claim refund.
Our findings show that patients respond more strongly to incentives when they are framed as deductibles than when they are
framed as no-claim refunds. Therefore, our findings are in line with the situation illustrated in Fig. 4, and they are compatible
with the explanation that individuals are loss-averse and form their reference point in a way so that they react more strongly to
incentives when they are framed in terms of losses instead of gains. This is our preferred explanation. Turning to our analysis for
subgroups, Tables 3 and 5 show that the difference in responses to no-claim refunds and deductibles is bigger for individuals with low
neighborhood income and high risk score than for individuals with high neighborhood income and low risk score, respectively. These
findings could be explained if persons with low neighborhood income and high risk score are more loss averse than other groups in
the population.
7.2. Timing of payments
An alternative explanation for our findings is that deductibles and no-claim refunds differ not only in the framing of cost-sharing
incentives, but also in the timing of payments. This raises the question whether the difference in the timing of payments could explain
our results. The timing of payments can matter for at least two reasons: time preferences and liquidity constraints. Patients might
prefer later payments to earlier ones, and they might find it hard to raise money on short notice to make an out-of-pocket payment.
33 This is the situation we have depicted in Fig. 1.
34 In our empirical analysis, for reasons we have given in Section 3, we study the reaction to current prices. The analysis is carried out on a monthly
level. The reasoning in the paragraph above also applies to the monthly level: Fig. 4 then shows utility defined over gains and losses at the monthly
level, when the reference point is wealth after the monthly premium has been paid.

Notes: Instrumental variables estimates. We take the difference in timing
into account by using the discounted current price instead of the actual
current price. We use an annual discount rate of 10 percent. We use data
at the monthly level. Expenditures are measured as the log of one plus
the actual amount. Standard errors are clustered at the risk score decile-
gender-age group-year level. ∗ 𝑝 < .10, ∗∗ 𝑝 < .05, ∗∗∗ 𝑝 < .01.
In general, the no-claim refund is paid out only at the end of the first quarter of the following year, whereas deductibles have to
be paid several weeks or months after the treatment. As explained in Section 2.3, there is a substantial delay between the time of
the treatment and the time at which the deductible payment is due. Figure C.1 in the Online Appendix shows that the average delay
between the treatment and the billing date from the health care provider to the insurance company is about 3.5 months. This is a
lower bound, because there is an additional delay before the insurer sends an invoice to the patient and because the payment is not
immediately due. Moreover, patients have the possibility to arrange with the health insurer to pay in installments.35
Can time preferences explain our findings? To find out how much discounting we would need to explain our findings, we first
assume exponential discounting and re-do our analysis taking the delay in payments into account. We assume a high, but still plausible
annual discount rate of 10 percent, and we allow for compounding within the year. Based on Figure C.1 in the Online Appendix, we
further assume a delay of 3.5 months under the deductible regime, corresponding to the deductible payment being due at the end
of the third month after the treatment. For the no-claim refund, we assume that the delay is 3.5 months in December, 4.5 months
in November, and so on, because the no-claim refund is paid out at the end of the first quarter in the following year. Making these
assumptions allows us to re-compute current prices and thus take the difference in timing into account. In particular, we set the
current price to (1∕(1 + 0.1))𝑚∕12 for payments 𝑚 months in the future.
Results are presented in Table 6. They are very similar to our main results presented in Table 2. Thus, exponential discounting at
a 10 percent rate is not enough to explain our findings.
Second, we use a stylized model to compute which discount rate would be high enough to explain the difference in effects between
deductibles and no-claim refunds that we find. Online Appendix B contains details of our calculations. We find that the annualized
discount rate would need to be higher than 400% to explain our results. We consider this discount rate to be implausibly large.36
Therefore, we believe that impatience alone cannot fully explain our findings.
Turning to liquidity constraints as a potential explanation, it follows from the institutional setup that deductible payments are
usually due with a substantial delay and that it is possible to pay in installments. This makes it less likely that liquidity constraints
are important. Moreover, we find in our analysis that the reaction to deductibles does not differ by neighborhood income. Together,
this suggests that also liquidity constraints cannot fully explain our results.
However, we also cannot exclude that impatience and liquidity constraints explain at least some of our findings. One reason is that
patients might perceive deductible payments as immediate even though they are not. If in addition they are also present-biased, then
this could partly explain the very high discount rates we compute. Moreover, our finding that there is no difference in the response
to deductibles by neighborhood income does not necessarily imply that liquidity constraints play no role. There is evidence that even
among the wealthy there are people who are liquidity constrained or act as if they were (Ericson and Sydnor, 2018; Kaplan and
Violante, 2014; Olafsson and Pagel, 2018).
35 The share of insurees (>18 years of age), who indicated having problems paying the deductible bill (and small co-payments), and with whom
the health insurer worked out some form of payment plan fluctuated between 2% and 10% across years (2011: 2%, 2012: 2%, 2013: 4%, 2014:
10%, 2015: 7%; source: undisclosed health insurer from which we have the data).
36 In Online Appendix B we show that this conclusion does not hinge on the assumption of exponential discounting.

7.3. The role of information
Another possible explanation why individuals react stronger to deductibles than to no-claim refunds is that they are better informed
about economic incentives under a deductible policy than under a no-claim refund policy. This can be the case if they are either better
informed about the policy rules or better informed about the price of care at a given point of time under a deductible policy.
Yet, as discussed in Section 2.4 knowledge about both no-claim refunds and deductibles was almost universal in the Dutch pop-
ulation throughout our study period with the exception of the year 2008 immediately after the introduction of the deductible. Also,
the way people were informed about whether they were above or below the cost sharing limit was similar under the no-claim refund
policy and the deductible policy.
7.4. Salience
A further possible explanation for different responses to no-claim refunds and deductibles could be related to the salience of cost-
sharing incentives. Salience can be defined as “the phenomenon that when one’s attention is differentially directed to one portion of
the environment rather than to others, the information contained in that portion will receive disproportionate weighting in subsequent
judgements” (Taylor and Thompson, 1982).
In the context of cost-sharing, Dalton et al. (2020) find that strong responses to spot prices, as opposed to expected end-of-year
prices, can be attributed to the greater salience of spot prices. In contrast, we compare the response to spot prices under a deductible
policy to the response to spot prices under a no-claim refund.
Our results could be explained by salience if more attention is drawn to cost-sharing incentives under a deductible than under a
no-claim refund. However, it is not clear why this should be the case in the Dutch institutional setting. Neither the no-claim refund
nor the deductible result in immediate payments at the time of treatment. Also, the information individuals receive about cost-sharing
incentives is comparable between the two cost-sharing schemes (see Section 2.4). While these factors point against salience as an
explanation for our findings, we cannot completely rule it out.
8. Validity of instruments and sensitivity analysis
In this section, we first assess whether the instruments we use are relevant. Then, we present results from a placebo test in order
to assess the credibility of our empirical approach. Next, we examine whether our results are driven by variation in the size of the
cost-sharing limit and changes in the basic health insurance plan across years. After this, we present results for a number of robustness
checks for alternative specifications of explanatory variables and outcome variables, and we examine whether our results are sensitive
to changes in the sample composition over time. Here, we also ask whether end-of-the-year effects could explain our results. All tables
are presented in the Online Appendix.
8.1. Instrument validity
One of the conditions for an instrument to be valid is that the instrument must be related to the endogenous variable conditional
on controls. Table C.2 shows that the simulated average price at the group level is highly predictive of the individual price 𝑝𝑖𝑡. The
relevant 𝐹 -statistics are extremely high. They are 1,216 and 8,046, respectively.
Turning to the exclusion restriction, one way to assess the credibility of our empirical approach is to perform a placebo test. In the
Netherlands children below the age of 18 are not subject to patient cost-sharing. For this reason, our main analysis was conducted
for a sample of individuals at ages 19 and above.37 If we apply our empirical approach to a sample of individuals between ages 15
and 17 and code the price as if they were actually subject to cost sharing, then we should not find any effect. And indeed, Table C.3
shows that price effects are not significantly different from zero for this group and also not significantly different from one another.
Thus, our empirical approach performs well in a setting where we know that the true parameters are zero.38
8.2. Variation in cost-sharing limits across years
The cost-sharing limit for the no-claim refund of 255 euros in 2007 was substantially higher than the cost-sharing limits in the
first years after introducing the deductible, which started at 150 euros in 2008. In our empirical approach, we examine how medical
spending depends on 𝑝𝑖𝑡, the price of the first unit of care in a given month. The computation of 𝑝𝑖𝑡 takes different cost-sharing limits
across years into account since it depends on whether or not patients have exceeded their relevant cost-sharing limit at a given point
of time. In our estimation equation, we also control for year dummies and the expected end-of-year price at the group level. However,
it is nevertheless possible that the response to 𝑝𝑖𝑡 depends on the cost-sharing limit. For instance, patients might react more strongly
to 𝑝𝑖𝑡 in years in which the cost-sharing limit is higher.
To investigate this, we estimate the effect of 𝑝𝑖𝑡 on medical spending separately for each year. Our empirical approach, described
in Section 5, can also be applied to individual years. Figure C.7 shows the results. For the no-claim refund there is only one year of
37 We did not include 18 year old individuals because we only observe the birth year and not the month of birth.
38 The standard errors for minors (the first column of Table C.3) are about 3 times larger than the ones for our main results (first column of Table 2).
This can mostly be explained by a smaller sample size, and it limits the power of the placebo test.

data. But for the deductible there was variation in the cost-sharing limit between 155 euros in the year 2009 and 375 euros in the
year 2015. If patients react more strongly to 𝑝𝑖𝑡 in years in which the cost-sharing limit is higher, one might expect that the reaction
to the current price becomes stronger over time. However, Figure C.7 shows that the effect of 𝑝𝑖𝑡 on medical spending is very similar
throughout the years when the deductible was in place.39 Overall, this suggests that the effect of 𝑝𝑖𝑡 on medical spending does not
depend on the cost-sharing limit.
8.3. Sensitivity analysis
Next, we conducted a number of additional robustness checks. We first examine whether or not our estimation results are sensitive
to different specifications of the covariates in 𝑥𝑖𝑡. These results are shown in Table C.4. Recall that in our baseline specifications 𝑥𝑖𝑡
includes variables for 5 year age brackets, gender, year and month dummies, indicators for the decile of the risk score, the future
price in January, and the log of expenditure in the previous 3 months plus 1. In the first column of Table C.4 we use a specification
with a full set of risk score-year interactions and a full set of year-month interactions. The results are similar to the baseline results
presented in Table 2, suggesting that a specification that is not fully-interacted in this way is general enough. For the second column
we include 6 lags of the log of the respective monthly expenditure plus 1 instead of the log of the expenditure in the previous three
months plus 1. Results are qualitatively similar as well. In the last column, we use the baseline specification but do not control for
the expected price at the end of the year. This again leads to qualitatively similar results, but now the magnitude of the estimated
effects is higher. Thus, we find that our main finding that the price effect is more negative under a deductible than under a no-claim
refund is robust to using different specifications of explanatory variables.
Next, we examine whether or not our estimation results are sensitive to the specification of the outcome variable. Recall that up
to now, we have used the log of expenditures plus 1. If we instead use the log of expenditures plus 0.1 or plus 10, then coefficients
will be rescaled.40 Table C.5 shows that indeed, adding 0.1 and 10 instead of 1 leads to different estimates—as could be expected. But
importantly, the main finding remains unchanged: the price effect is more negative under a deductible than under a no-claim refund.
Table C.5 also shows that estimation results remain essentially unchanged when we change the definition of health care expenditure
and exclude expenditures on mental health care and geriatric care. These were included in the basic health insurance plan only in
later years.
Next, we investigate whether results are different for different definitions of our sample. Results are shown in Table C.6. In column
(1) we restrict the sample period to one year before and after the change from a no-claim refund to a deductible, respectively, by
using data for the years 2007 and 2009 only. We have excluded data from the year 2008, because in 2008 we would use data from
2007 to construct control variables and many patients were not yet aware of the policy change. By excluding data from 2008, we have
a cleaner separation between the period in which the no-claim refund was in place and the period in which there was a deductible.
Results are similar to our main results for all years. In column (2) we show results for a balanced sample of individuals who are
in our sample in all years from 2006 until 2015. In this way, we assess whether our results are sensitive to changes in the sample
composition over time during our study period. Results for the balanced sample are similar to the baseline results for the full sample.
Our final robustness check concerns the shifting of health care expenditures across years (Cabral, 2016). For some types of health
care, individuals can influence the timing of treatment. For example, they can choose whether they will receive a cataract surgery
now or some months later. Individuals who have exceeded their cost-sharing limit in the current year have an incentive to shift
treatments from the next year to the current year, because at the start of the new year patient cost-sharing limits will be reset. For
those patients, the price of care in the current year is zero, but the price of care at the beginning of the next year is one. To see
whether the shifting of care between years has an impact on our estimation results we estimate a model that in addition to the other
covariates also includes an interaction term between the price 𝑝𝑖𝑡 an indicator for the month of December. The results presented in the
first column of Table C.7 show that this does not substantially change the coefficients for the price effects under the two cost-sharing
schemes. Interestingly, however, individuals do seem to be more sensitive to the price of care in December than in other months, as
one would expect. In the second column we do not use data for December and find results that are very similar to the ones presented
in the first column and to our baseline estimates.
9. Conclusions
In this study we compare the effects of patient cost-sharing incentives on health care expenditures under a deductible policy and
a no-claim refund policy. We estimate that average annual health care expenditures are about 8.6 percent lower under a deductible
policy than under a no-claims refund policy, as patients react more strongly to deductibles than to no-claim refunds.
39 There is one exemption to this. In the first year in which the deductible was in place, the effect was comparable to the effect of the no-claim
refund. As explained in Section 2.4, in 2008 only 42% of respondents to a representative survey knew about the deductible. One year later this share
increased to 95%.
40 For a simple example suppose that there is a claim with probability 0.4 under no cost-sharing and that the claim size is 50 conditional on
there being a claim. Assume that the price effect of cost-sharing is a reduction in the probability that there is a claim by 10 percentage points and
a reduction in the claim size by 50 percent once there is a claim. Then, the difference between the expected log of expenditure plus 1 under no
cost-sharing and the expected log of expenditure plus 1 under cost-sharing is −0.33. If we use respectively 0.1 and 10 instead of 1, then we arrive at
−0.42 and −0.23. This shows that the constant one adds will matter. The estimated effect will tentatively be smaller in magnitude if we add a bigger
number, at least in this example.

Cabral,2016

Our preferred explanation for these results is that individuals are loss-averse and respond differently to both schemes since they
perceive a deductible payment as a loss and a no-claim refund as a gain. We also discuss alternative explanations such as time
discounting, liquidity constraints, the role of information, and salience. Based on additional empirical evidence and in light of the
institutional details we conclude that these alternative explanations are less likely to explain our findings.
Our finding that the framing of incentives can have a large and economically important effect on health care expenditures is
directly relevant for designing patient cost-sharing schemes. For example, some Dutch health insurers have recently started to offer
insurance contracts that allow insurees to pre-pay their deductibles in monthly installments. For these contracts, individuals receive
a refund at the end of the year if they have not exceeded their deductible limit, effectively turning the deductible into a no-claim
refund. Within a short period around 800,000 insurees have signed up for this scheme. If patients who pay their deductible in
monthly installments behave similar to patients under a no-claim refund then our simulation results predict that total annual health
care expenditures are around 8.6 percent higher than under a standard deductible. In their calculation of insurance premiums Dutch
health insurers do not take this behavioral effect into account. Thus, offering the seemingly innocent option to pre-pay deductibles
in monthly installments might cause substantial losses for insurers and lead to an increase in health care costs.
More generally, our results suggest that discussions on the optimal design of cost-sharing incentives should not only focus on
coinsurance rates and cost-sharing limits, but they should also revolve around the question how these are presented to patients.
