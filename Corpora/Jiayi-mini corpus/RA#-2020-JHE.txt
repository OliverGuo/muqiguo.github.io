Late childhood and adolescence is a critical time for social and emotional development.
Over the past two decades, this life stage has been hugely affected by the almost universal
adoption of the internet as a source of information, communication, and entertainment.
We use a large representative sample of over 6300 children in England over the period

2012–2017, to estimate the effect of neighbourhood broadband speed, as a proxy for inter-
net use, on a number of wellbeing outcomes, which reflect how these children feel about

different aspects of their life. We find that internet use is negatively associated with well-
being across a number of domains. The strongest effect is for how children feel about their

appearance, and the effects are worse for girls than boys. We test a number of potential

causal mechanisms, and find support both for the ‘crowding out’ hypothesis, whereby inter-
net use reduces the time spent on other beneficial activities, and for the adverse effect of

social media use. Our evidence adds weight to the already strident calls for interventions
that can reduce the adverse effects of internet use on children’s emotional health.

1. Introduction

Late childhood and adolescence is a critical and poten-
tial vulnerable time for social and emotional development.

One aspect of this life-stage that has changed dramatically
in the past 20 years is the almost universal adoption of the
internet as a source of information, communication, and
entertainment. United Nations research has estimated that
3.5 billion people (47 per cent of the world population) use
the internet globally; one third of these are under 18.1 In
the UK, today’s teenagers have grown up with the internet
and now spend more time online than they do watching
television (Ofcom, 2015). Almost all 12−15 year olds (98

%) use the internet; with 96 % accessing it at home via a
fixed broadband (BB) connection, and a large proportion
also using a mobile network signal (Ofcom, 2015). “The
internet is not just something children access when they want
certain bits of information; it is an essential and intrinsic part
of the world they inhabit” (House of Lords, 2017).
Internet use can have both beneficial and detrimental
effects on children’s wellbeing because ofthe wide range of
activities that are undertaken online.2 Jackson et al. (2008)
describes a ‘utopian’ view, where the internet provides a

chance to develop the skills needed for the modern work-
place, as well as new opportunities for self-expression,

2 The same argument can be made for adults. Fujiwara et al. (2018), in
their analysis of the wellbeing effects of the UK Superfast BB programme,
find a negative association between BB speed and adult life satisfaction

using Annual Population Survey data; although they find a positive asso-
ciation using UKHLS data.

communication and access to information. However, she
contrasts this with a ‘dystopian’ perspective where time

online ‘crowds out’ other beneficial activities such as read-
ing, playing sports and face-to-face interaction with friends

and family, as well as exposing children to potentially

inaccurate and harmful content, and sexual and commer-
cial exploitation. Early empirical studies, largely based on

cross section surveys of teenagers, lend support to an over-
all negative effect of internet use on wellbeing (Brenner,

1997; Kraut et al., 1998). However, more recent evidence
is inconclusive, with, for example, Bauernschuster et al.
(2014) finding a positive association between internet use
and social capital, but Lohmann (2015) finding a negative
influence of internet use of wellbeing, operating largely via
relative income effects.
The potentially detrimental effects of online activity
have prompted concern in the UK among a number of

bodies responsible for the mental health and wellbe-
ing of young people.3 A recent enquiry on ‘children and

the internet’ by the House of Lords (2017) concluded
that the current regime of self-regulation very often put
commercial considerations first, with scant regard for
wellbeing.4 The enquiry acknowledged the association

between increasing numbers of unhappy and anxious chil-
dren and the growth in internet use, but also called formore

robust research into the possible causal relationships.5 Our
study is an attempt to respond to that call; we explore the

association between children’s emotional health and inter-
net use, and also consider a number of potential causal

channels, which we investigate empirically.
Children’s use of the internet is an important topic for
study because it is a significant component of time use, and
its effects on wellbeing and mental health are ambiguous
(Kalmus et al., 2014). Most of the existing evidence comes
from samples of adults, or students in higher education (see
for example Cotton, 2008; Bhuller et al., 2013). There is
very little evidence for children, and that which does exist
tends to comemainly fromcross sectiondata, andrelatively
small, bespoke samples (see for example Gross et al., 2002;
Jackson et al., 2008).
In this study we use neighbourhood BB speed (as
reported by Ofcom) as a proxy for internet access. There is
increasing evidence to suggest that children do not regard
the internet as a separate, distinct entity that they access;
rather it is woven ubiquitously throughout all aspects of
3 The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
recently cited social media as a major cause of the dramatic increase

in the numbers of children admitted to hospital as a result of self-
harming (www.nspcc.org.uk/). An inquiry into cyberbullying by the

charity Young Minds and The Children’s Society was carried out in 2017
https://youngminds.org.uk/resources/policy/cyberbullying-inquiry/.
Barnardo’s, the children’s charity, produced a ‘youth and the internet’
guide for policymakers in 2015 (Barnardo
s, 2015). 4 In 2019, the government published a White Paper setting out their
recommendations for reducing online harms, particularly among children
(HM Government, 2019). 5 Recently, a cross-parliamentary enquiry on ‘the impact of social
media and screen-use on young people’s health’, again cited the lack
of evidence of causal relationships: www.parliament.uk/business/

committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-
committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/impact-of-social-media-young-
people-17-19/

their life. For this reason, self-reported data on time spent
on the internet may be misleading. In addition, children
use the internet for a wide range of diverse activities, and
it is likely that the impact on their wellbeing depends on
the quality and type of activities they are engaged in. Our
data contains only limited information on what children
are doing online. Instead, we assume that faster BB speeds
mean that children can access more content in a given

amount oftime.Hence, wemight expectto observe anasso-
ciation between BB speed and child wellbeing because of

the enhanced internet access enabled by faster BB speeds.
We improve on the majority of existing evidence on the

effects of internet use, firstly, using a large nationally rep-
resentative sample of children, rather than a small survey

of a selective group. Secondly, we utilise measures of emo-
tional health across different domains, which enable us to

explore which aspects of children’s lives are most affected.

Thirdly, we explore a number of potential causal mecha-
nisms that can help to explain why internet use affects

emotional health. Fourthly, we use longitudinal data and

fixed effects (FE) models, in order to eliminate endoge-
nous selection bias arising from time-invariant unobserved

variables, such as childhood circumstances or neighbour-
hood characteristics, which influence both wellbeing and

BBspeed.We also explore indetailthe assumptionof quasi-
random assignment of BB speed, which is necessary for us

to identify the effect of BB speed on psychological wellbe-
ing. Finally, we also consider which groups of children are

most affected by use of the internet.
Our results are worrying for anyone concerned with

children’s emotional health. We find a negative relation-
ship between internet use and wellbeing domains. In our

most stringent specification, children feel worse about
their schoolwork, appearance, friends and the school they
attend, as internet use increases. For example, a 1 % increase

in BB speed reduces how children feel about their appear-
ance by approximately 0.6 per cent. The adverse effects

of the internet are worse for girls than boys, and the
strongest effect (for both sexes) is for how they feel about
their appearance. Our evidence also suggests that these

results can be explained via the ‘crowding out’ hypothe-
sis, whereby internet use reduces the time spent on other

beneficial activities, and from the adverse effect of social
media use.
2. Broadband speed and children’s wellbeing
The potential influence of the internet on the emotional
health and wellbeing of children is attracting increased
attention across a range of disciplines. Castellacci and
Tveito (2018) review this disparate literature and classify
the relevant mechanisms through which the internet can
affect wellbeing into four distinct channels. Their review

does not consider children explicitly, but all of these chan-
nels have particular implications for children, which we

attempt to draw out here; we also test a number of these

causal channels in our empirical work. Children’s wellbe-
ing can be affected directly in the ways described below,

but also indirectly via intergenerational effects; parents’
behaviours and wellbeing can be shaped by internet use
and this will in turn affect their children (see Pfeffer and

E. McDool, P. Powell, J. Roberts et al. / Journal of Health Economics 69 (2020) 102274 3

Schoeni, 2014). Further, there are reasons to expect that
children may be particularly vulnerable to some of the
mechanisms described below. As well as being at a critical
stage of social and emotional development, children often
adopt technological innovations before parents, schools or
policy makers can consider the lasting implications of this
technology. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that
internet content is increasingly consumed via a tablet or

phone, and this move to smaller, portable devices is mak-
ing adult supervision much more difficult than when the

internet was largely accessed via a single family computer.
The internet can influence wellbeing firstly because it
changes time use patterns. On one hand, this can make
existing tasks, like shopping, coursework and job search,
more efficient, thus freeing up time for other activities. For
example, by aiding job search the internet could improve
parents’ labour market outcomes, helping them to find jobs
that better match their skills or exit unemployment spells
more quickly, which in turn affects the child’s wellbeing.

Gürtzgen et al. (2018) found that, in Germany, digital tech-
nologies helped the unemployed find a job. On the other

hand, there is evidence that the internet can crowd-out
other activities known to be beneficial for wellbeing, such
as playing sport and having face-to-face interactions with
friends and family (Moreno et al., 2013; Wallsten, 2013).
Further, in evidence given to the House of Lords (2017)

enquiry, Barnardo’s, the children’s charity, warns that chil-
dren are far from being fully informed, rational consumers

when it comes to online commercial transactions. Ofcom
research suggests that less than half of 12−15 year olds

were aware of paid endorsements by vloggers or person-
alised advertising; they also could not spot advertising in

online search results (Ofcom, 2015).
Secondly, the internet facilitates new activities, which
can have positive or negative effects on wellbeing. The

internet has enabled online gaming and digital social net-
works, whicharenow almostubiquitous intheiruse among

children; it also facilitates access to on demand entertain-
ment via traditional media sites such as online television,

as well as specialist online sites such as YouTube and
music streaming apps like Spotify. While these activities

can have important positive effects such as enabling chil-
dren to develop creativity and social skills, and providing

opportunities both for stimulation and relaxation, there is
increasing concern about the potentially negative effects
such as addiction, commercial exploitation and increased
chances of exposure to inappropriate content (Kuss and
Griffiths, 2012). In addition, there is some evidence that

new activities such as gaming and streaming entertain-
ment displace time spent on schoolwork (Kaiser Family

Foundation, 2010).

Thirdly, the internet enables greater access to infor-
mation; this can contribute to social and educational

development.However,theproliferationofinaccurate con-
tent, ‘fake news’ and inappropriate sexual and/or violent

content on the internet can be damaging to children’s
wellbeing. Further, while there is no conclusive evidence
yet, there are suggestions that overwhelming exposure to
information in itself may be affecting concentration and
decreasing attention spans, in adults as well as children

(Carr, 2010). Also, in common with many adults, chil-
dren do not have an understanding of how search engines

work and have limited knowledge to enable them to judge
the accuracy or providence of online information (Ofcom,
2016). In a review of the effects of computers, software
and the internet on education, Bulman and Fairlie (2016)
argue that, while increased availability is associated with

increased use, few studies find positive effects on educa-
tional outcomes. Faber et al. (2015) explore the effects of

internet speed on test scores for English primary and sec-
ondary school students over the period 2002–2008, and

find no significant effects on student time spent studying
online or offline, or on their educational outcomes.
Much of the material that children are exposed to
online can be classified as inappropriate (Martellozzo et al.,

2016), and pornography has emerged as a particular con-
cern. The British Board of Film Censors argue that “This

has led to the normalisation of largely unfettered access to
the strongest, sometimes unlawful, pornography by children
online”.6 Young people themselves are also expressing their
concerns about pornography on the internet; in a survey
of 500 young people, 80 % said that it was too easy to

access pornography online, and 72 % felt that this was lead-
ing to unrealistic views about sex, particularly among boys

(Institute for Public Policy Research, 2014).7
Fourthly, the internet provides new communication
tools, such as email, instant messaging, social media, Skype
and Facetime. These tools have the potential to increase
both the scope and intensity of social interactions, both

of which are among the strongest predictors of wellbe-
ing (Kahneman et al., 1999). Social media use has grown

extremely rapidly, and is a core part of young people’s
lives. A survey in 2015 revealed that, in the UK, 92 % of

16–24 year olds had used social networks, such as Face-
book, Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram, in the last three

months.8 Younger children are also increasingly users of
social media; while most sites stipulate a minimum user
age of 13, few require any validation, and a survey for
the children’s BBC television channel found that more
than three quarters of 10–12 year olds had social media
accounts.9 Social networks are children’s primary interface
with the internet. These portals are generally used in an
‘always on’ state, often via smartphones and tablets, such
that many children are permanently connected to their
virtual social network, continually receiving and checking
feed, and regularly posting their own updates (Boyd, 2014).

For this reason, we believe that social media use is poten-
tially a very important mechanism through which internet

use can influence children’s emotional health. The results
that we present in section 4 below lend support to this

6 House of Lords (2017) para. 130. 7 Online bullying (discussed below) is also intertwined with the nor-
malisationof online sexual content.Almosthalf of 18 year-oldsquestioned

in the same survey stated that sending naked pictures to each other
(known as ‘sexting’) was part of everyday life; and thatthese pictures were
often shared more widely in an attempt to bully and shame individuals. 8 www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/

view. For this reason, we spend some time here considering
this mechanism in more detail.

Digital social networks serve a multiplicity of func-
tions. They are a tool for developing and maintaining

interpersonal relationships, a real-time portal for access-
ing information, news, advice and social support, as well

as a canvas for sketching a selective and idealised self-
portrait. While it is generally acknowledged that social

media can have a positive impact on social capital, for

example by enhancing friendships and decreasing loneli-
ness (Franzen, 2003; Antoci et al., 2012),there are concerns

that ‘excessive’ time spent on social media is associated
with low self-esteem, common mental health problems,
and socioemotional difficulties (e.g., Beardsmore, 2015;
Kross et al., 2013). Evidence is also emergingdemonstrating
a detrimental effect of social media use on sleep (Levenson

et al., 2016).10 There is also evidence that online commu-
nication substitutes for face-to-face interactions (Sabatini

and Sarracino, 2017). Helliwell and Huang (2013) compare
face-to-face friends with online social networks in an adult
Canadian sample; they find a positive correlation between
the size of real and online social networks, but that only

increases in the number of face-to-face friends are associ-
ated with improved wellbeing.

There are two additional complementary theories that
can help to explain why extensive social media use may
have a negative effect on children’s emotional health, on
top of the ‘crowding out’ hypothesis discussed above in

relation to internet access in general. First, ‘social compari-
son’ theory, posits that increased social media use is linked

to more frequent social comparisons, which are more likely
to be ‘upward’ (negative) in direction. The material people
choose to present online represents selectively idealised
versions of their true lives (Mendelson and Papacharissi,
2010), and there is evidence that young social media users

act naively, in that they fail to understand that the mate-
rial is not representative (Royal Society for Public Health,

2017).11 Sabatini and Sarracino (2016) find that social net-
work users in Italy have a higher probability of making

social comparisons than non-users, and that this tendency
is greatest in younger people. In related work, Clark and
Senik (2010) found that, in Europe, people with internet
access attach more importance to income comparisons
than those without, and Lohmann (2015) finds that people

who regularly use the internet as a source of informa-
tion derive less satisfaction from their income. Chou and

Edge (2012) found that students who spent more time
on Facebook were more likely to think that other people

were happier and had better lives than their own. Further-
more, a growing body of research attests to the mediating

role of envy in the relationship between Facebook use and
decreased affective wellbeing (e.g., Tandoc et al., 2015;
Verduyn et al., 2015). Issues of body image and self-esteem
10 ‘Fear of missing out’ is linked to obsessive checking of social media
feeds and sleep problems, with almost of half of pupils questioned in
a survey admitting to checking their mobile devices after going to bed.

Brief-FINAL.pdf

11 Enke (2017) presents experimental evidence that this irrationality is
also present in adult behaviour.

have been raised as a particularly negative aspect of greater
social media use, especially among girls (Kleemans et al.,
2016; Children’s Society, 2018a). While, these concerns are
not a new development(and have been linked in the pastto
women’s magazines for example), the internet and social

media increase the accessibility and immediacy of unreal-
istic body images, thus intensifying their effect.

Secondly, ‘cyberbullying’ theory, relates to the fact that
children who spend more time on social networks have a
greater chance of being the victim of direct attacks from
others on their sense of self, wellbeing, and self-esteem
(Cowie, 2013). Childline counselling services reported a 12

percentincrease inthenumber of cases related to cyberbul-
lying in 2016/17 compared to the previous year (Children’s

Society, 2018b). Sampasa-Kanyinga and Hamilton (2015)

reported a significant increase in the odds of being vic-
timised for every hour spent using social networking sites.

While cyberbullying oftenoverlaps withtraditional‘offline’
bullying,the formermay beparticularlypernicious because
children’s continual connectedness means they cannot
escape (Slonje et al., 2012).12 Arecent study for the US using
micro data from the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, found
that cyberbullying influences suicidal behaviour (Nikolaou,
2017), and there have been a number of high profile cases
involving teenagers taking their own lives in part because
of being harassed over the internet (Hinduja and Patchin,
2010).
3. Data and methodology
In this paper, we use data from Understanding Society

– The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), a repre-
sentative sample of over 40,000 households across the UK

(University of Essex, 2018). Eight waves are currently avail-
able, starting with wave 1 in 2009, which provided data on

over 50,000 individuals, andthe latest wave 8 (atthe time of
writing) where over 39,000 individuals were interviewed

between 2016 and 2018. All adult members of each house-
hold are interviewed, along with children aged 10–15 years

old. In this analysis, waves 3–8 are used;these provide data
on just over 6300 children residing in England, who are the
focus of the empirical analysis.13
Children’s data comes from the Youth Self-completion
Questionnaire, which is used alongside data from the adult
surveys, giving information on household characteristics
such as income, homeownership and parental education.

The outcomes of interest are obtained by asking chil-
dren how they feel about different aspects of their life,

specifically: school work; appearance; family; friends; school
attended; and life as a whole (see Appendix, Table A1 (In
Supplementary material)). Internet use may affect these

12 A number of economic studies have illustrated the negative and per-
sistent effects of being bullied in childhood. For example, Eriksen et al.

(2014) find detrimental effects of being bullied on educational attainment
in a large Danish sample. Brown and Taylor (2008) find that being bullied
at school in the UK has an adverse effect on human capital accumulation
both at and beyond school. 13 We do not use UKHLS waves 1 and 2 because Ofcom data on BB speed
are not available for those years at the level of disaggregation required.
Similarly, the Ofcom data is available for LSOAs in England only.

domains of children’s wellbeing differently, and perhaps
even in opposing directions, hence it is useful to be able to
disaggregate wellbeing in this way.We order the responses

to range from “1=not happy at all” through to “7= com-
pletely happy”. We interpret these measures as indicators

of psychological wellbeing or emotional health (see Clark
et al., 2018).After conditioning onmissing values, we create
an unbalanced panel of 6310 children for the period 2012
(wave 3) through to 2017 (wave 8). Out of this sample 36 %
of children are observed once, 27 % twice, 17 % three times,
11 % four times, 6 % five times and 3 % in all waves, giving
a total number of observations 13,938 across children and
over time.

Data are available from Ofcom, the UK communica-
tions regulator, on the average synchronisation speed of

existing BB connections, measured in megabits per sec-
ond (mbps). This is defined at the neighbourhood level,

where neighbourhoods are classified via Lower Layer Super
Output Areas (LSOA).14 LSOAs are very small areas; there
are 32,844 LSOAs in England, with an average size of
650 households; and the children in our sample reside in
3765 LSOAs. The UKHLS provides LSOA identifiers for each
household, enabling us to match neighbourhood BB speed

to our sample of children. The BB speed data are avail-
able across all years 2012–2017 and are matched to the

LSOA-year in which the child was interviewed. The sam-
ple of children we draw on live in households that do not

change address during the period, which is important as
the analysis is based upon location FE.
3.1. Reduced form approach
For ease of interpretation we standardize each outcome
to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of unity,15
and condition on a set of covariates and BB speed. The
reduced form models we estimate are of the following
form:
yijw = X’
ijwˇ + Zjw +  ̨i + j + w + εijw (1)
where i(= 1,.., 6310), j(= 1,.., 3765), w (= 3,.., 8) denote
the child, the neighbourhood in which the child lives
(LSOA), and wave of interview respectively; the outcome

of interest is denoted by yijw and Zjw is the average neigh-
bourhood BB speed. The error term is normally distributed

εijw∼N (0,  ̇) and  ̨i, j, w denote child, neighbourhood
and time specific FE, respectively. Eq. (1) is estimated
using FE analysis, where the inclusion of FE eliminates
endogenous selection bias arising from time-invariant
unobserved variables, e.g. childhood circumstances or

neighbourhood characteristics, which influence both well-
being and BB speed. Our interest lies in the sign and

statistical significance ofthe estimate ˆ, which, based upon
the quasi-random assignment of BB (considered in detail
below) gives the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect of BB speed
14 The average synchronisation speed is the average speed at which the
modem connects with the internet; itis a key BB performance metric used
by Ofcom. The data are available from www.ofcom.org.uk 15 Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Frijters (2004) show that assuming cardinality

for ordinal measures of wellbeing is acceptable in models where individ-
ual effects are included, as is the case in our analysis.

on psychological wellbeing, capturing the causal effect
of being assigned to treatment (see Angrist and Pischke,
2009).
The covariates in vector Xijw control for individual child,

parent, household and local area characteristics and com-
prise: age, specifically whether aged 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14

(with aged 15 as the omitted category); whether male; the
number of children aged 0–2, 3–4, 5–11 or 12–15 in the
household16; whether either of the child’s parent(s) own

their house, are employed, or have a degree or equiva-
lent qualification; whether the child lives in a single parent

household; the natural logarithm of real equivalized net

household income; and local area characteristics (includ-

capita, the share of females, the share of the population
over 65, and the share of the population of working age)
defined at the Local Authority District (LAD) level, to proxy
for local economic conditions.17
Full variable definitions are given in the Appendix, Table
A1. Summary statistics are shown in Table 1. Fig. 1 shows
histograms of the distribution of each dependent variable

prior to standardization. Clearly, across each of the psy-
chological wellbeing outcomes, on average children report

towards the upper of the scale, although for feelings about
their school work and appearance the mean response is
lower and the standard deviation higher in comparison
to the other domains; approximately 20 % of respondents
state that they are ‘completely happy’ with their school
work and/or appearance.
Approximately 51 % of children are aged 13–15 and just
under half are male. In terms of family background, 77 % of
children have atleast one parent who is either an employee
or self-employed, 33 % of parents have a degree; 22 % of
children live in a single parent household; the average real
net equivalized household income is £1326 per month; and
67 % of parents own their home either outright or with a
mortgage. Table 1 shows that the average BB speed over
the period was just under 26 mbps. Fig. 2 provides kernel
density plots of the neighbourhood average BB speeds for
each year, where clearly the average speed, and also the

variance, has increased over time. Fig. 3 shows the distri-
bution in growth in BB at the LSOA level for each wave as a

complement to Fig. 2, where growth occurred between all
waves.
Fig. 4 shows a map of England split into LSOAs where
white areas are not included in our sample. The map shows
London along with the eight core cities of England with
boundaries given in blue. By considering quartile ranges
of average BB speed over time at the LSOA level, the map
highlights where the variation in BB speed comes from. It

would appear that BB speeds are highly dispersed, not con-
centrated in any one particular region, and not dominated

by large cities, e.g. London (noticeably there is evidence of
variation in BB speed across quartiles within London).

16 For the categories 5-11 and 12-15 the number of children excludes
the respondent. 17 In the UKHLS there are 330 LADs in England. The LAD variables are
obtained from www.nomisweb.co.uk which is a service provided by the
Office for National Statistics containing official labour market statistics.

3.2. Random allocation
The empirical approach adopted relies only on an
assumption of quasi-random assignment of BB and does

not require an exclusion restriction. BB rollout in England
has been a complex mix of commercial and government
initiatives. The bulk of commercial rollout, which was

E. McDool, P. Powell, J. Roberts et al. / Journal of Health Economics 69 (2020) 102274 9

largely demand driven, was completed before our analy-
sis period starts in 2012 (Department for Digital, Culture

Media andSport, 2018). Existing service quality was a result
of a number of factors including poor home wiring, long
telephone lines and random network effects (Department
for Business Innovation and Skills and Department for

Culture Media and Sport, 2009). The government sub-
sidised superfast BB programme was announced in 2010

in response to concerns that commercial deployment
would fail to reach many parts of the country where

installation would not be profitable for a number of rea-
sons (Department for Business Innovation and Skills and

Department for Culture Media and Sport, 2010).18 The

government provided £780 m of public resources for a sub-
stantial programme developed in partnership with Local

Authorities, who were expected to match central govern-
ment funds on a one-to-one basis. Local Authorities were

also responsible for procurement and management of con-
tracts with local suppliers, resulting in a large amount of

local variation (Department for Digital, Culture Media and

Sport, 2018). Recently published evaluation evidence sug-
gests that the areas that benefitted from this subsidised

rollout had features that were expected to reduce the com-
mercial viability of upgrading local infrastructure; these

included, being further from the exchange, having a higher
share of ‘exchange only’ lines and having a low density of
premises (Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport
(2018).19 The evaluation also reveals that schemes were
primarily concentrated in rural areas with comparatively
low population densities but any differences in economic
performance were less apparent (Department for Digital,
Culture Media and Sport (2018).
Overall, the subsidised programme, which was rolled
out in the period coinciding with our analysis period,
substantially distorted commercial demand driven BB
installation. As a result, we do not expect BB speed in our

analysis period to be systematically related to local socio-
economic characteristics. We also explore this assumption

empirically following Bhuller et al. (2013), who investi-
gate whether increased internet access triggers sex crimes,

and Akerman et al. (2015), who estimate whether or not

the adoption of BB internet by firms enhances labour pro-
ductivity. Firstly, we regress BB speed on neighbourhood

(LSOA) and time FE, and area (LAD) level time varying char-
acteristics (unemployment, population shares, education

and GVA per head). We find that 83 percent of the variation

in BB speed is attributable to time-invariant neighbour-
hood characteristics and common time effects, whilst less

than 1 percent is due to time-varying covariates (which
might pick up demand and supply effects associated with
improving BB speeds). Secondly, we consider the timing of

increasing BB speed, as revealed in Fig. 2, and baseline char-
acteristics, which are evaluated at the start of the sample

18 Superfast BB is usually interpreted as meaning download speeds of at
least 24 megabits per second. 19 BB connections are made over a copper cable, which can either be
connected to a roadside cabinet near the premises, or directly to the
local telephone exchange. This latter type of ‘exchange only’ connection
requires a more expensive upgrade procedure to enable the premises to
access superfast BB.

period, by estimating the following at the neighbourhood
level:
Zjw = j + 
ıw × X ̄ j,2012

’ w + εjw (2)
where Zjw is the first difference in average BB speed
across waves, i.e. Zjw = Zjw − Zjw−1, shown in Fig. 3, ıw is a
vector of time fixed effects and the vector X ̄ j,2012 contains

the 2012 mean of all child-family and area level covari-
ates averaged at the neighbourhood level. Table 2 reports

estimates of w and joint tests for each covariate of w

across waves. It would appear that generally there is no sys-
tematic relationship between improving BB performance

and the control variables. More importantly, there is lit-
tle correlation with area-level background variables such

as the unemployment rate, GVA per capita,20 and popula-
tion shares. This suggests that service expansion was not

concentrated in those locations where the economy was
growing fastest (or slowest). Moreover, the variation in the
growth of BB speed shown in Fig. 3 did not just occur in

years where the covariates predict the change in BB con-
nection, see Table 2, and indeed perhaps not surprisingly

thepredictivepower ofthemodelis weak where the overall
model F-statistic only has a p-value of 0.42.
Furthermore, we require that increasing BB speed is
uncorrelated with the time-varying factors that influence
psychological wellbeing. Following the approach of Altonji
et al. (2005a, 2005b) we also test this by considering
selection on observables as an indication of selection on
unobservable effects. This is undertaken for the full sample
of children and sub-samples of potential interest, e.g. males
and females, since the effect of gender cannot be recovered
in the FE framework of Eq.(1), where we explore the extent

to which the BB speed is correlated with the part ofthe out-
come explained by the covariates. Specifically we estimate

the following for each outcome:
cov

X’
ijwˇ, Zjw

 ̨i

/var 
Zjw

 ̨i
 (3)
Table 3 shows the results of this where it is clear that
for each domain across the full sample and the sub-groups,
the correlation between X

ijwˇ and Zjw is very low and

practically indistinguishable from zero. This result is con-
sistent with the assumption that increasing BB speed is

uncorrelated with the time-varying factors that influence
psychological wellbeing. To summarise we conclude that

quasi-random assignment of BB in our data is a reason-
able assumption, whereby the estimate of , from Eq. (1),

provides the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect of BB speed on
psychological wellbeing.
4. Results
In this section, we firstly estimate the reduced form
model of Eq. (1) for the full sample of children, before
20 The only exception, albeit at the 10 per cent level, is for GVA per head,
consistent with the finding of Bauernschuster et al. (2014) for Germany.

Moreover, contrary to expectations, results show that where individu-
ally statistically significant the effect is associated with lower growth in

internet speed, e.g. between 2012-13, ˆ 3, a 1% increase in GVA per head
is associated with 0.086 per cent reduction in the growth of BB speed.

is shown for each outcome.

considering heterogeneity across a number of sub-groups.
Finally, we explore potential mechanisms that may be
capable of explaining the results.
4.1. Reduced form analysis
Table 4 presents the coefficients on Zjw, i.e. ˆ the ITT,
showing the effect of BB speed on each of the wellbeing

domains reported in each column. We report four differ-
ent specifications of Eq. (1): (i) Panel A with no control

variables, just child FE; (ii) Panel B incorporating covari-
ates, Xijw, which include child and family characteristics as

well as local economy controls (unemployment rate; GVA
per head; share of females; share of population over 65;
and the share of the population aged 16–65) and child FE;
(iii) Panel C also incorporating time FE; and (iv) Panel D,
incorporating the full set of covariates, time, area and child
FE.
Focusing initially on the FE models in Panels A and
B, across each domain there is a negative association

with BB speed, i.e. ˆ < 0. The inclusion of covariates gen-
erally reduces the parameter estimate on Zjw but the

effect remains statistically significant. Looking at Panel B
a 1 % increase in BB speed decreases happiness in each
of the domains ranging from 0.008 standard deviations
(around 0.8 per cent) for appearance to 0.005 standard
deviations for life overall. In Panel D, which is the most

stringent specification, BB speed remains statistically sig-
nificant for four out of the six domains, where a 1 %

increase in BB speed decreases happiness with appearance
by 0.006 standard deviations (i.e. an ITT of around 0.6 per
cent).

We compare the effect of BB speed to the other con-
trol variables in Table 5, which reports the full results from

Panel C of Table 4. Interestingly, where statistically signif-
icant, younger children generally feel happier than those

aged 15 (the omitted category) across each domain, whilst
there are no effects stemming from household income. In
related work, Anand and Roope (2016), who consider child
wellbeing in Germany, also found no income effect, whilst,
analysis from the US reveals that parental earnings are
positively associated with a number of childhood health
outcomes (Mazumder and Davis, 2013). Those children

residing in a single parent household have lower psycho-
logical wellbeing for appearance and life overall. What is

evident is that in a FE framework few child level and area
level covariates are statistically significant, yet BB speed
has a negative effect on four of the wellbeing domains.
Focusing upon appearance the coefficient on Zjw is on
average approximately a tenth of the magnitude of the

coefficient associated with whether the child lives in a sin-
gle parent household, so arguably not a trivial effect. This

is consistent with concerns about the negative influence of
the internet on body image.
In Eq. (1) BB speed is assumed to have a linear effect
on each domain. We now relax this by replacing Zjw in
Eq. (1) with a set of binary indicators for whether the BB

speed is between: 10 and less than 20 megabits per sec-
ond (mbps); 20 and less than 30 mbps; 30 and less than

40 mbps; 40 and less than 50 mbps; 50 and less than 60
mbps; and 60 mbps and above, respectively. The results
of this analysis are shown in Table 6, which incorporates

full controls, area, year and child FE. Clearly, there is evi-
dence of linearity in that the higher BB speed is associated

with worse wellbeing across all domains where statisti-
cally significant and the effect is monotonic, i.e. increasing

in magnitude. For example, considering appearance hav-
ing a BB speed between 20 and 30 mbps is associated with

0.11 lower standard deviations, but this rises in magnitude
to a 0.36 standard deviation reduction in wellbeing for BB
speeds at 60 mbps and above.
4.2. Sub-group analysis
By looking at the entire sample of children, we may
be missing important differences across the distribution

of children – i.e. the effects of BB speed may have het-
erogeneous impacts across different groups of children.

Hence, we also consider the following sub-groups: male
and females; children aged below 13 and those aged 13 and
above; and urban and rural areas. Eq. (1) is re-estimated

for each of these groups. Table 7 shows the results split-
ting the sample of 6310 children by gender (Panels A and

B), age (Panels C and D), and urban-rural location (Pan-
els E and F). All estimates incorporate controls as well as

area, time and child FE. Considering gender differences,

where statistically significant, the largest effects are appar-
ent for girls, hence it would seem that BB speed is more

detrimental for wellbeing across each domain for girls –
with the largest effect stemming from how girls feel about

Notes: 1 BB refers to broadband speed which is defined as a set of binary indicators for whether the average synchronization speed is between: ≥10 and <20 megabits per second (mbps); ≥20 and <30 mbps;
≥30 and <40 mbps; ≥40 and <50 mbps; ≥50 and <60 mbps; and ≥60 mbps, respectively. 2 Controls include: age; number of children in household aged 0–2; number of children in household aged 3–4; number
of children in household aged 5–11; number of children in household aged 12–15; whether live in a single parent household; whether parent(s) own home; whether either parent has a degree; log equivalized
real household income; and year of interview. We also include 320 Local Authority indicators, i.e. area fixed effects, and the following LAD level covariates, the natural logarithm of: the unemployment rate; GVA
per capita; share of females; share of population over 65; and share of population aged 16–65.
their appearance

; again consistent with body image con-
cerns. In Panels C and D, the sample of children is split

by age, specifically whether aged below 13 or aged 13 and
above.21 The largest effects are all for those children aged
13 and over. The only significant effects of BB speed for
those children under the age of 13 are on appearance and
family
, where
a
1

% increase in BB speed reduces happi-
ness in these domains by around 0.007 and 0.006 standard

deviations respectively.
Although we have controlled for area (LAD) level
covariates and area FE, it is possible that children in
more geographically isolated localities have worse internet

access, and also fewer opportunities to engage in activi-
ties (such as sports, or interacting with friends) that could

affect their psychological well-being. To investigate this,
in Table
7 Panels
E and
F we split the sample according
to whether the child lives in an urban or rural location.22

No significant effects are found for children in rural house-
holds, but the negative effect of BB speed holds across each

domain, for those children living in urban areas.
4.3. Potential mechanisms
This section explores the potential mechanisms that
may explain the negative association between BB speed
and wellbeing domains, discussed in Section
2
. Firstly, for

children living in

a household with unemployed parent(s)
a faster internet connection may help parents find jobs
that better match their skills or exit unemployment spells
more quickly. Secondly,

a faster internet connection may

affectthe happiness ofthe parents, which in turn may influ-
ence the happiness of their children. Thirdly, an improved

internet connection may be associated with children’s aca-
demic outcomes. Fourthly, the internet may crowd-out

other activities that the child would otherwise have under-
taken which in turn reduces wellbeing. Finally, we consider

whether BB speed is associated with children’s use of social
media.
To investigate each of the above channels we take
a
two-step approach. Firstly, we explore whether each of
the mechanisms has

a direct influence on each domain of
children’s wellbeing, to do this we estimate the following: yijw = X

where the results are shown in Table

BB speed
(

tion, by estimating:

21 Given that BB deployment increases over time (see Fig.
2
) as does age
of the children, splitting into age categories may help to disentangle these
two effects. 22 Urban areas are defined as settlements with

a population of 10,000 or
more according to Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs

has a degree; log equivalized real household income; and year of interview. We also include 320 Local Authority indicators, i.e. area fixed effects, and the
following LAD level covariates, the natural logarithm of: the unemployment rate; GVA per capita; share of females; share of population over 65; and share
of population aged 16–65.
The results of this analysis are shown in Table 9, where

for brevity we only report ˆ. From an empirical perspec-
tive, for a mechanism to be capable of explaining the link

between BB speed and children’s wellbeing one would
expect the estimates of both  and to be statistically
significant.
Initially, focusing upon on transitions in labour market

state, we consider transitions of either parent from unem-
ployment in the previous time-period into employment in

the current year, giving a sample size of 5668 based on 2987

children. Table 8 Panel A shows that there is no associa-
tion between parental transition into employment and any

child wellbeing domain, and in Table 9 Panel A clearly BB
speed has no significant effect on this potential mechanism
(where Eq. 4b is estimated as a linear probability model).
Next turning to the duration of the parents unemployment
spell, based upon a sample of 5047 covering 2716 children
who currently have an unemployed parent, there is some
evidence of an inverse relationship between the length
of time that the parent has been unemployed and their
child’s feelings about school work and school (Table 8 Panel
B). However, it would appear that parental labour market
experience is not a potential mechanism as BB speed has

no significant effect on the duration of parental unemploy-
ment. Moreover, the coefficient is positive where a priori

we would expect it to be negative, with faster internet con-
nection allowing parents to exit unemployment quicker,

perhaps due to enabling a better job match (maybe due to
improved job search through online resources or through
being able to obtain additional formal job interviews, e.g.
see Gürtzgen et al., 2018).
We now consider the wellbeing of the parent as a
potential mechanism for the effect on child wellbeing. We

measure parental psychological wellbeing using the Gen-
eral Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), which covers various

dimensions, including: depression; anxiety; somatic symp-
toms; feelings of incompetence; difficulty in coping; and

sleep disturbance (Goldberg and Williams, 1988).23 The
GHQ-12 score is onthe scale 0 (the leastdistressed)through

to 12 (the most distressed). After removing missing val-
ues on parental GHQ-12 the focus is upon a sample of

13,227 observations comprising 6069 children. The results
shown in Table 8 Panel C reveal an inverse relationship

between the parents GHQ-12 score and children’s well-
being across the domains school work, appearance and life

overall, i.e. parents in more distressed states have children

with lower wellbeing in these domains,  <ˆ 0. This is con-
sistent with an intergenerational correlation in wellbeing.

However, whether this is the mechanism through which
BB speed is operating is doubtful given the estimate of the

23 The GHQ-12 is a widely used screening instrument for common
mental disorders, in addition to being a general measure of psychiatric
wellbeing.

Each row represents a separate regression model; notes as per Table 8.
association of the speed of the internet connection with
GHQ-12; ˆ, is statistically insignificant, as can be seen from
Table 9 Panel C.24
A key potential mechanism through which BB speed
may be operating is that ofthe child’s educational progress.
As part of the National Curriculum assessment in England,
statutory Standard Attainment Tests (SATs) are undertaken
throughout a child’s school years. We explore attainment
via two alternative outcome measures relevantfor children
of different ages. Key Stage 2 tests are taken when children
are aged 10–11, and Key Stage 4 (GCSE) tests are usually
taken when children are aged 15/16.25 For Key Stage 2 our
outcome is the percentage of children obtaining level 4
or more in reading, writing and mathematics SATs where
the test score ranges from 1 to 100.26 For Key Stage 4 our
outcome is the percentage of children who achieve five or
more A* to C grades, including Mathematics and English.27
Unfortunately, these educational outcome measures are
not available at the child level. Instead, we use LAD area
level outcomes (for the LAD of pupil residence), which are
defined consistently over the period 2013–2015 for Key
Stage 2 and 2012-17 for Key Stage 4.28 For this area level

analysis we average child wellbeing scores (for the appro-
priately aged children) for each domain at the LAD-year

level and all other covariates are also averaged accord-
ingly. These data are then matched at the LAD-year level

to the Key Stage test results. For the Key Stage 2 results we

24 In terms of the mechanisms considered so far: labour market transi-
tions are based upon either the mother or father exiting unemployment

into a state of employment; the duration of the unemployment spell is
the average across both parents; and the GHQ-12 score is also averaged
across both parents, where applicable (i.e. couple households). The same
results hold if we consider the father only, the mother only, or single
parent households. Results are available upon request. 25 Note thatinformation on Key Stage 3, SATs taken between ages 11 and
14, stopped being collected in 2011 with information from 2009 based
solely upon on-going teacher assessment. 26 https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-key-stage-2.
The national expectation for children in English schools is that children
reach a level 2/3 by the end of Year 2 (Key Stage 1 SATs) and a level 4/5

by the end of Year 6 (Key Stage 2 SATs). 27 https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-gcses-key-
stage-4

28 Ideally, the analysis would be at the child level. However, currently
this is not possible by matching in the National Pupil Database (NPD) to
the UKHLS as the matched NPD data is only available for those children
interviewed in UKHLS wave 1, and the NPD data for these children is only
available up to 2012/13.

focus on children aged 10 and 11, yielding a sample of 778

observations. For the Key Stage 4 results we focus on chil-
dren aged 15 giving a sample of 1096 observations. For this

analysis, the regressions in Eqs. (4a) and (4b) are based at
the LAD level conditional on annual mean characteristics
incorporating area FE.
The results are shown in Table 8 Panels D (Key Stage
2) and E (Key Stage 4); these reveal no relationship
between test scores in reading, writing and mathematics
(Key Stage 2 performance), or GCSE attainment (Key Stage
4 performance) and any of the child wellbeing domains.
However, interestingly BB speed is strongly positively
associated with Key Stage 2 attainment, and negatively
associated with Key Stage 4 attainment, as can be seen
from Table 9 Panel D (E). This evidence suggests that
the effect of faster internet speeds on child wellbeing
domains is not operating through educational attainment.
This is consistent with the findings of Faber et al. (2015)
who report that even very large changes in available

internet speeds have an estimated zero effect on educa-
tional attainment (i.e. when summed across different Key

Stages).

Next, we consider whether a faster internet connec-
tion potentially crowds out beneficial activities that the

child might otherwise engage in. In waves 4, 6 and 8 of

the UKHLS children were asked a series questions regard-
ing the activities that they undertake, including: playing

sports; face-to-face interaction with friends and family;

going to youth clubs or other organised events; undertak-
ing voluntary or community work; and attending out of

school classes such as art, music etc. Focusing upon a sub-
sample of 5150 children (7389 observations) present in

these waves, we sum the number of activities thatthe child

undertakes at least once per week. The number of activi-
ties ranges from zero (13.5 %) to six or more (2.5 %) where

on average children undertake two activities at least once

a week. Table 8 Panel F shows that the number of activi-
ties that the child undertakes is positively associated with

wellbeing, and significantly so for four out of six domains.

In Table 9 Panel F, we explore whether BB speed is poten-
tially crowding out face-to-face interaction. The estimate

onBBspeedisnegative andstatistically significant, whichis
consistent with the crowding out hypothesis whereby the

internet reduces the number of activities the child under-
takes, which ultimately results in lower wellbeing (Moreno

et al., 2013; Wallsten, 2013).

18 E. McDool, P. Powell, J. Roberts et al. / Journal of Health Economics 69 (2020) 102274
The final mechanism we explore is the role of social

media. Given that social media sites are children’s pri-
mary interface with the internet, we believe that they may

represent a key channel for the effects of internet use on
wellbeing. In the Youth Self-completion Questionnaire of
the UKHLS children are asked: Do you belong to a social
website such as Bebo, Facebook or Myspace? 65 % of the
respondents were members of a social network and were

subsequently asked: How many hours do you spend chat-
ting or interacting with friends through a social website like

that on a normal school day? The responses to this question
are coded into the variable range from “1=none”, “2=less
than an hour”, “3 = 1–3 h”, “4 = 4–6 h”, and “5 = 7 or more
hours”. We replace the 1–5 scale with “midpoints” of the
ranges (i.e. 0, 0.5, 2, 5, and 8) since arguably this is a better

approximation of the linear effect and also enables inter-
pretation of the impact an additional hour spent online.29

In Tables 8 and 9 Panels G to I we consider: the number
of hours spent online; non-linearity by exploring whether
children spend 5 or more hours online; and then whether
the child is a member of a social media site, respectively.
For hours spent online and intense time spent using social

media (i.e. 5 h or above), the sample size is 9948 com-
prising 5235 children; whilst for membership of a social

network the corresponding observations are 13,938 and
6310 respectively (the sample size for time spent online
is slightly lower due to missing values on hours).
Focusing on hours spent online and the association with
children’s wellbeing, Table 8 Panel G reveals thattime spent
online is inversely related to each domain and statistically
significant, with the exception of friends. For example, an
extra hour spent online decreases the wellbeing score of

appearance and school work by around 0.03 standard devi-
ations (i.e. approximately 3 per cent). Similarly, spending

a large amount of time online (5 h or more), has a large
inverse association with all wellbeing domains apart from

friends, see Table 8 Panel H; thus it appears that the neg-
ative effects of social media use are intensified with high

use.
Another aspect which we investigate is the decision to

use social media, where again there is an inverse relation-
ship across three of the six domains, see Table 8 Panel

I, although perhaps not surprisingly, the magnitude of
the effect is not as large as that seen in Panel G from
extremely high daily time spent online. It would appear

that time spent online using social media sites is a plau-
sible mechanism, but empirically this rests upon > 0,

i.e. faster internet speed should a priori result in more
time spent using online sites, and moreover whether the
estimate is statistically significant. This is investigated by
estimating Eq. (4b), with the results reported in Table 9
Panels G to I, where greater internet speed is associated
with more time spent online, intense usage (five or more

hours) and membership of social media sites. This is evi-
dence in favour of social media being a key mechanism

that could link BB speed to child wellbeing;30 in contrast,

29 We are grateful to an anonymous referee for this suggestion. 30 These results might also explain why in the sub-group analysis the
effects of BB speed were only observed for older children, given the

evidence of other mechanisms possibly operating through

parental outcomes, e.g. in the labour market or intergener-
ationaltransmission of wellbeing, or the child’s educational

progress, are not evident in the data.
5. Conclusion

In this paper we have explored the effect of inter-
net use on the psychological wellbeing of children aged

10–15, measured by the way they feel about five differ-
ent aspects of their life, and their life overall. Internet use

is proxied by the BB speed available in the neighbour-
hood. We employ a FE framework where, based upon the

quasi-random allocation of BB speed, we recover the ITT

effect, which shows that even in the most stringent spec-
ifications estimated there is evidence of a negative causal

relationship between faster BB speed and domains of chil-
dren’s wellbeing. The largest effect from a 1 % increase

in BB speed is for how children feel about their appear-
ance, decreasing the score by approximately 0.6 per cent on

average. A number of potential channels are investigated

as possible mechanisms capable of explaining this phe-
nomenon. The empirical analysis provides supportfor both

the ‘crowding out’ hypothesis (whereby beneficial activ-
ities are sacrificed for more time spent on the internet)

and also for the adverse effect of increased social media
use.
The internet, and social media in particular, are hugely
important phenomena of the past decade. Given the extent
of use among children and adolescents, concern with the
potential adverse (and long-term) effects on children’s

emotional health is increasing. The results of our analy-
sis are important given the central role of these platforms

in children’s lives, and the fact that childhood wellbeing
has been shown in previous research to have persistent
effects into adult life (e.g. Lindeboom et al. (2010); Conti

and Heckman (2014) and Bertoni (2015)). Our results sug-
gest that interventions to appropriately limit internet and

social media use during childhood may help to improve
emotional health.
