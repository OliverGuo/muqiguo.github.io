"transcriptional response (transcriptional memory) [15, 16],",Corpora/bio/Lamke et al. (2017).txt
during which the priming stimulus induces either,Corpora/bio/Lamke et al. (2017).txt
sustained changes in gene expression (activation or repression) or a modified transcriptional response (such,Corpora/bio/Lamke et al. (2017).txt

The hypothesis that traits that are acquired in one generation could be transmitted to following generations,Corpora/bio/Lamke et al. (2017).txt
was first put forward by Lamarck in the 19th century. In,Corpora/bio/Lamke et al. (2017).txt

Methods,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
Quantifying Plant Growth Climatic Thresholds,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
We used the rate at which terrestrial vegetative matter is produced (NPP) as a proxy for plant,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
growth. Derived values of NPP were obtained from 8-d averaged MODIS data (the finest temporal resolution available; data source in S2 Table). MODIS NPP data are modelled using remotely sensed satellite data and have been cross-validated by other studies [45]. To estimate,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
"climate thresholds for plant growth, we overlaid 8-d maps of derived NPP onto 8-d maps of observed temperature (i.e., near-surface air temperature), water availability (using soil moisture",Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
"in upper 10 cm of the soil column as proxy), and solar radiation (i.e., surface downwelling",Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
shortwave radiation) (sources provided in S2 Table). This allowed us to calculate the total,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
amount of 8-d NPP produced along gradients of each of the three climate variables and their,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
interactions. We defined NPP climatic thresholds as the boundaries that surround the climatic,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt

"Variability in thresholds. To project global plant growth suitability, we used thresholds",Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
"broad enough to encompass the current sensitivities of most plants (S8 Fig) and kept them static for comparison, but we recognize that those thresholds can change. Thresholds could change",Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
"either at the species level (through genetic adaptation, but see [46]) or at the community level",Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt
(through replacement of species with those that are more tolerant today [2] or those that have,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt

(2015).txt
growing days are expected in tropical countries with limited economic capacity (Figs 2 and 5).,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt

Correlative nature of our approach. Our analysis uses the modern distribution of where,Corpora/bio/Mora et al. (2015).txt

"Contractile injection systems (CISs) are phage tail-like nanomachines, mediating bacterial cellCcell interactions as either type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) or extracellular CISs (eCISs). Bioinformatic studies uncovered a phylogenetic group of hundreds of putative CIS gene clusters that are highly diverse and widespread; however, only four systems have been characterized. Here we studied a putative CIS gene cluster in the marine bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis. Using an integrative approach, we show that the system is compatible with an eCIS mode of action. Our cryo-electron microscopy structure revealed several features that differ from those seen in other CISs: a cap adaptor located at the distal end, a plug exposed to the tube lumen, and a cage formed by massive extensions of the baseplate. These elements are conserved in other CISs, and our genetic tools identified that they are required for assembly, cargo loading and function. Furthermore, our atomic model highlights specific evolutionary hotspots and will serve as a framework for understanding and re.engineering CISs.",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt

"n most ecological settings, bacteria do not exist as isolated cells, but interact with other organisms1. These cellCcell interactions are often mediated by macromolecular machines that trans-locate effector proteins into the medium or directly into a target cell2C4. Bacterial contractile injection systems (CISs) mediate cellC cell interactions between bacterial and eukaryotic cells and often confer competitive advantage in different environmental niches. CISs are macromolecular injection devices with an overall struc-ture that is homologous to the contractile tails of bacteriophages5C8. Their conserved modules include an inner tube, a contractile sheath and a baseplate complex. For firing of the extended apparatus, the baseplate undergoes a conformational change and triggers sheath contraction, which in turn causes the inner tube to be expelled and injected into a target. On the basis of distinct modes of action, bacterial CISs are clas-sified into extracellular CISs (eCISs) and type VI secretion systems (T6SSs). eCISs resemble headless phage particles that are assembled in the bacterial cytoplasm and then released into the medium upon cell lysis. Upon binding to a target cell via tail fibres9, eCISs contract and puncture the targets cell envelope10. By contrast, T6SSs remain intracellular and are anchored to the inner membrane11C14, injecting effectors by a cellCcell contact-dependent mechanism15. Classical T6SSs (subtypes iCiii) and R-type pyocins (eCISs) form relatively homogeneous groups of CISs. Recent bioinformatic anal-yses revealed an additional phylogenetic group of CISs with high abundance and diversity16C19. This group comprises hundreds of putative CIS gene clusters, with only a few of them being studied so far. A comprehensive bioinformatic study suggested that these CISs cluster into six distinct phylogenetic clades (Ia, Ib, and IIaCIId)17. Characterized representatives are only found in clades Ia and Ib and include Photorhabdus virulence cassettes (PVCs)20, antifeeding prophages (AFPs) from Serratia21, metamorphosis-associated con-tractile structures (MACs) from Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea22, and the T6SS subtype iv (T6SSiv) in Candidatus Amoebophilus asiaticus16. While PVCs and AFPs in clade Ia act as individual, pyocin-like eCISs with insecticidal functions, MACs and T6SSiv in clade Ib were shown to have diverse functions. MACs form sea mine-like arrays of ~100 tethered eCISs that induce metamorphosis of larvae of the marine tubeworm Hydroides elegans, and addition-ally kill insect cells as well as murine macrophages in vitro22,23. The T6SSiv probably mediates the escape of symbiotic Amoebophilus bacteria from the phagosomes of its amoeba host16.",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"Given the co-existence of systems with different modes of action and diverse targets in clade Ib, an atomic model of such a CIS assembly would be particularly insightful. The complicated super-structures in MACs and T6SSiv, however, impede their structural characterization16,22. Current high-resolution structural information is limited to clade Ia, that is, PVC and AFP24,25.",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
Here we performed structural and mechanistic studies on a clade Ib CIS gene cluster in the marine bacterium Algoriphagus machi-pongonensis PR1. This strain was previously co-isolated with the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta26 and was shown to induce the formation of multicellular colonies (rosettes) of S. rosetta27C29. Bioinformatic analyses showed that ~69% of bacteria in the Algoriphagus genus harbour a putative CIS gene cluster19.,Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt

"similarities with potential CIS structural components, besides addi-tional proteins with unknown functions. Guided by sequence simi-larities to other CISs, we re-labelled the genes as alg1-18 according to the homologues in AFP (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Since there is no homologous protein of ALPR1_12705, a putative tail fibre with Ig-like folds, we labelled it alg19. Previous genome analyses classified CISs into six subtypes17, with AlgoCIS being clas-sified as Ib along with MACs22 and T6SSiv (ref. 16). This was further supported by our phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 1b).",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"To explore whether A. machipongonensis expresses any AlgoCIS particles, crude sheath purifications were performed and imaged by negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (EM). Typical CIS-like particles were found in both extended and contracted states (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of the same sample detected 14 proteins encoded in the AlgoCIS gene cluster (asterisks in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2). To further confirm these results, we disrupted the AlgoCIS gene cluster by inserting a plasmid into the AlgoCIS operon (AlgoCIS.). Since no CIS-like particles were detected in AlgoCIS. mutant (Extended Data Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2), we conclude that the AlgoCIS gene cluster encodes CIS-like complexes.",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"To observe AlgoCIS in a cellular context, we imaged A. machi-pongonensis cells by cryo-electron tomography (cryoET). We fre-quently observed AlgoCIS particles in the bacterial cytoplasm but never anchored to the membrane (Fig. 1c), which is incompatible with a T6SS mode of action. CryoET analyses and western blots of bacteria at different optical densities (OD600) indicated that the aver-age expression level was highest (~3.8 AlgoCISs per cell) at high OD600 growth phases (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d).",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"We further analysed the supernatants from wild-type and AlgoCIS. cultures by western blot, negative-stain EM and MS. Using antibodies against Alg1 (inner tube) and Alg2 (sheath), we detected AlgoCIS in the supernatant of a wild-type culture (Extended Data Fig. 1e). We could also observe AlgoCIS particles by negative-stain EM (Extended Data Fig. 1f) and detected most putative structural components in the supernatant via MS (Supplementary Table 2). Taken together, these results indicate that AlgoCIS is consistent with an eCIS mode of action.",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"Overall structure and unique features of the AlgoCIS particle. To gain insights into the general structure of AlgoCIS, purified particles were imaged by cryoET. Sub-tomogram averaging showed that the AlgoCIS particle is ~130 nm long and ~30 nm wide, with the tube lumen filled with densities (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). The structure can be divided into three modules: cap, sheath tube and baseplate. All three modules have 6-fold symmetric features (Extended Data Fig. 1i).",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"To reveal molecular high-resolution details, we imaged purified AlgoCISs for cryoEM single particle analysis and processed them as was previously shown for other CISs24,25,30 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The quality of the final maps from the three modules allowed for de novo structural modelling (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b, and Supplementary Fig. 1a and Table 3). Symmetry-related protein subunits were generated and merged into a complete model on the basis of the entire AlgoCIS map.",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"Out of the 18 proteins in the AlgoCIS gene cluster, 13 were local-ized in the final reconstruction, with 11 proteins having atomic models built (Fig. 1d). Two proteins with unknown functions (ALPR1_12695 and ALPR1_12690) were detected by MS, but were not identified in the cryoEM map (Supplementary Table 2).",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"The final model of AlgoCIS comprised 318 polypeptide chains, including 23 sheath layers (Alg2-L1C23) and 22 inner tube layers (Alg1-L1C22) (Fig. 1d). While our structural analyses showed a gen-eral overall agreement with reported structures of other eCISs24,25, AlgoCIS represents the subtype Ib clade and revealed remarkable features (Fig. 1e).",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"Cap and cap adaptor proteins terminate AlgoCIS. The distal AlgoCIS end is terminated by a hexameric cap complex of Alg16A, and C in contrast to other known eCISs C a hexameric complex of Alg16B, hereafter referred to as the cap adaptor (Fig. 2a). The dome-shaped Alg16A cap complex covers the inner tube, and it exhibits an ~11-.-wide central channel (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4a). Each Alg16A subunit interacts with three Alg1 proteins from the distal inner tube layer (Alg1-L22) and terminates the tube (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Compared with homologues in PVC/AFP, Alg16A is much shorter (197 amino acids in Alg16A, 293 in Pvc16, 295 in Afp16) and folds into a single domain with a C-terminal extension. Structural superposition showed that the Alg16A struc-ture is similar to the N-terminal domains (NTDs) of Pvc16 and Afp16 (Extended Data Fig. 4c).",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"Interestingly, the cap adaptor Alg16B mediates the interactions between the cap complex Alg16A and the most distal sheath layer (Alg2-L23). The cap adaptor expands the outer diameter of the cap to ~164 ., with an enlarged inner diameter of ~115 . (Fig. 2a). The Alg16B NTD (residues 1C213) is an immunoglobulin-like domain flanked by three additional -helices (1C3), whereas one single -barrel constitutes a C-terminal domain (CTD) (residues 214C284) (Fig. 2b). The Alg16B adopts a parallel arrangement with Alg16A (Extended Data Fig. 4d). The N terminus of Alg16B interacts with the C terminus of Alg16A in a mimicked handshake manner, ter-minating the sheath assembly (Fig. 2c).",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"Next we set out to explore the role of the cap adaptor. Due to the lack of available precise genetic tools in A. machipongonensis, we developed a genetic toolset31,32 to generate clean in-frame dele-tions (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). We thus created an AlgoCIS Alg16B deletion and showed by cryoET imaging that it assembled different classes of aberrant AlgoCIS particles (Fig. 2d). Of the particles, ~49.8% (ntotal =223) had an overall simi-lar shape compared with the wild type; however, sub-tomogram averaging showed that the cap, cap adaptor and the distal sheath layer (Alg2-L23) were all absent (Fig. 2e).

Additionally, ~13.4% were TBC complexes with contracted sheath, similar to the contracted with jammed tube particles seen in MACs22. Moreover, the tube lumen was empty for all observed par-ticles in AlgoCIS Alg16B (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 2). Together, these results showed that the cap adaptor plays an impor-tant role in stabilizing the cap module and the most distal sheath layer, and its absence results in mis-assembled particles.",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"The sheath-tube module reveals diverse structural conforma-tions across sheath layers. Six protofilaments of sheath proteins adopt a right-handed helical array with a length of 92.4 nm and an outer diameter of 24.6 nm (Fig. 1d). Unlike the multiple sheath proteins present in PVC/AFP, the AlgoCIS sheath is composed of only one protein, Alg2, which folds into four domains (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). The conserved domains I and II contribute to the sheath wall, with additional domains III and IV extending outwards (Extended Data Fig. 5c). The sheath subunits are interwoven with each other via a conserved handshake and iteratively assemble into the full sheath, where the attachment helix in domain I mediates the interactions with the inner tube (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e).",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"Interestingly, depending on its location in the different sheath layers, Alg2 exhibits pronounced structural variations. Both the N and C termini of Alg2 have different conformations in the proximal (Alg2-L1), distal (Alg2-L23) and central sheath layers (Alg2-L2C22) (Extended Data Fig. 5f). The hinge angles of domain IV were also observed to be different when comparing the different Alg2 layers.

"There are extensive contacts between Alg6, Alg8 and Alg7 (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e), suggesting that Alg6 is essential and functions as a nucleus for particle assembly. To test this hypoth-esis, we generated and analysed a Alg6 mutant. Remarkably, no assembled AlgoCIS particles were found in a sheath preparation of the knockout (Extended Data Fig. 6f). We also detected putative plug homologues in the closely related MACs, as well as in the T6SSiv (accessions JF50-12690/Aasi_1078) (Extended Data Fig. 6g). We deleted the plug homologue in MACs in P. luteoviolacea and purified mutant MACs23,36. Negative staining resulted in no detect-able MAC arrays (Fig. 3e).

Three-dimensional-focused classifica-tion revealed diverse conformations for the gp7-like part of Alg12 (Extended Data Fig. 7d). It is responsible for interactions with tail fibres. In contrast to AFP/PVC24,25, the AlgoCIS tail fibres do not fold back to contact the sheath, but instead attach on the lateral sur-face of the wedges and extend downwards (Fig. 1d).

"Alg11 extensions form a unique spike cage. AlgoCIS exhibits a remarkable structural feature on the baseplatethe formation of an extensive cage around the central spike. Therefore, Alg11 is much longer and folds into six domains compared with the homologues (Fig. 4b). The Alg11 domain I forms the conserved core bundle together with the domains I and IV in Alg12 (Fig. 4a). The Alg11 N terminus extends across the cleft between domain I and VI (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7f). Interestingly, there is one additional large domain (IV, residues 278C643) protruding from the distal tip of domain III (Fig. 4b). The domains IV from the six protomers form a hexagonal cage that surrounds the spike (spike cage). The outer surface of the spike cage is negatively charged, with one posi-tively charged residue at the tip (Lys572) (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 7g). The lumen of the spike cage ranges in diameter from 56 . to 18 . and a tip cavity is filled by Alg10 (Fig. 4c). A Dali search38 sug-gested that domain IV comprises two carbohydrate-binding mod-ules (CBM1 and CBM2) (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7h) and the key residues mediating sugar binding in the protein TmCBM27 (PDB entry: 1OF4)39 are conserved in CBM1 of Alg11 (Extended Data Fig. 7h).

"Since a spike cage has never been seen in any of the previous high-resolution structures, we investigated its presence in the clos-est AlgoCIS relatives, namely in MACs and T6SSiv.

Subsequent sub-tomogram averaging of both the MAC and T6SSiv baseplates revealed that both also contained cage-like structures that were similar to AlgoCIS (Fig. 4d).

Furthermore, neither the fusion of a periplasmic trans-location tag (Tat system), nor the co-expression of Cgo1/Cgo2 mitigated the inhibiting effect of Cgo1 (Extended Data Fig. 9d).

Conclusions,Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"Besides the classical T6SSs (subtypes iCiii) and pyocins (eCISs), recent bioinformatic genome analyses uncovered a significant addi-tional phylogenetic group of CISs16C18. In addition to their abun-dance across sequenced bacterial genomes, an intriguing feature of this group is the co-existence of eCISs and T6SSs among very close relatives in clade Ib. The high-resolution structures presented here and in an accompanying study49, will serve as a framework to understanding the evolution and function of these related systems. In this regard, our discovery of features such as the cap adaptor, plug and spike cage are significant, since we found that they were con-served in many other systems (Fig. 6a).",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"Another major insight is the identification of evolutionary hotspots. Our data suggest that the gp7-like part of the baseplate wedge-component Alg12 and its homologues mediate the forma-tion of superstructures (Fig. 6b). In T6SSiv, up to 34 individual T6SSiv structures form ordered arrays, mediated by lateral interactions of the baseplates16. In MACs, ~100 individual eCISs form ordered arrays, mediated by long tail fibres that connect neighbouring eCISs22. The structural comparisons enabled by the AlgoCIS struc-ture presented here suggest that the gp7-like baseplate components are probably involved in mediating these interactions C directly in T6SSiv and by binding the long tail fibres in MACs (Fig. 6b, cyan). AlgoCISs, AFPs and PVCs are thought to act as individual eCISs and the gp7-like baseplate component (Fig. 6b, cyan) mediates con-tacts with different types of tail fibres.",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt

Alg19, however, rather adopts an orientation downwards, with the general structure being found to be similar to the corresponding region in the canonical T6SS baseplate component TssK.",Corpora/bio/RA1-NM2022.txt
"A second evolutionary hotspot that is revealed by the compari-son of the AlgoCIS structure with sub-tomogram averages of MACs and T6SSiv is a binding site at the cage domain of Alg11 homologues (Fig. 6b, orange). This site mediates the attachment of short tail fibres in MACs and the attachment of the entire apparatus to the inner membrane in T6SSiv.

The assembled plasmid was then electroporated into SM10 E. coli, with the sequence of the assembled product being confirmed via DNA sequencing before being conjugated with A. machipongonensis on MB agar plates and incubated at 30 C overnight. The following day, the mating spots were resuspended in MB and re-plated onto MB agar plates containing 100 g ml.1 erythromycin and grown for at least 48 h at 30 C. Colonies that formed were confirmed to have the pCHIP3 plasmid inserted via PCR, with good clones being grown in MB for 48 h at 30 C, shaking at 200 r.p.m. After incubation, 1 ml of the culture was spun down and washed twice with filtered artificial seawater before being plated on MB agar plates containing 10 mM 4-chloro-dl-phenylalanie and incubated at 30 C for at least 72 h. Individual colonies that formed were then screened for loss of plasmid and confirmed for the gene deletion via PCR, as well as being sequenced to confirm the clean knockout.

"Background: Infectious bacterial diseases exhibiting increasing resistance to antibiotics are a serious global health issue. Bacteriophage therapy is an anti-microbial alternative to treat patients with serious bacterial infections.

"Results: Our paper demonstrates a largely unchanged microbiota profile during 4 weeks of phage therapy when added to systemic antibiotics in a single patient with Staphylococcus aureus device infection. Metabolomic analyses suggest potential indirect cascading ecological impacts to the host (skin) microbiome. We did not detect genomes of the three phages used to treat the patient in metagenomic samples taken from saliva, stool, and skin; however, phages were detected using endpoint-PCR in patient serum.",Corpora/bio/RA10-M2021.txt

Background,Corpora/bio/RA10-M2021.txt
"Staphylococcus aureus is a common commensal of the skin and anterior nares which can cause an array of ser-ious human diseases, ranging from mild skin infection to life-threatening endocarditis and septicemia. The ability of S. aureus to rapidly adapt to selective pressures, such as antibiotics, is exacerbated by biofilm formation on im-planted medical devices [1].

"of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and few new antibi-otics in the pipeline, there is a growing need to consider non-antibiotic alternatives to treat serious bacterial in-fections [2]. One such alternative is the use of bacterio-phage therapy (BT) [3, 4]. Bacteriophages are viruses that selectively infect and, in the case of lytic phages, kill their target bacterial host. Some have anti-biofilm activ-ity as well which may be helpful for treating device in-fections. Additional potential advantages include synergy of phage-antibiotic combinations to either directly lyse bacterial host cells, or apply selective pressure that at-tenuate virulence (e.g., biofilm formation), and/or re-sensitize bacteria to specific antibiotics [5].",Corpora/bio/RA10-M2021.txt

"We previously reported the case of a 65-year-old male with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation in 2014 for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. He developed a persistent Staphylococcus aureus LVAD infection in 2015 associated with sternal osteomyelitis and recurrent bacteremia despite multiple surgical debridements and prolonged courses of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. The infection persisted and precluded heart transplant sur-gery, and so the patient was treated with BT as an ad-junct to antibiotics initiated in April 2018 [6]. A combination of three anti-staphylococcal bacteriophages (AB-SA01; NCT03395769; Armata Pharmaceuticals) at a dose of 3  109 plaque forming units was administered intravenously (IV) as an outpatient every 12 h for 28 days. The patient received concomitant IV cefazolin 2 g every 8 h and oral minocycline 100 mg twice daily [6]. Of note, the patient had been on IV cefazolin for the past 2.5 months prior to the initiation of BT; he also re-ceived multiple courses of prolonged IV antibiotics over the past approximately 2.5 years prior to BT. The patient was successfully treated when BT was combined with antibiotics, had negative sternal wound bacterial culture at end of therapy (day 28), and underwent successful heart transplantation a week after completion of BT [6]. In this proof-of-principle study, we aimed to understand possible cascading ecological effects to the patient-microbiome as potential effects of BT on the host-microbiome during phage therapy are not well characterized.",Corpora/bio/RA10-M2021.txt
Results,Corpora/bio/RA10-M2021.txt
"Patient samples were self-collected throughout the dur-ation of BT, which represented gut, saliva, and skin (nares, axillary, and forehead) microbiomes for analysis; samples were collected every 12 h with the exception of fecal samples, which were once daily. The first set of pa-tient samples was collected within 24 h of commencing BT, and extended to 7 days post-phage therapy (i.e., the day before heart transplant surgery). Amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing generated 29,633 reads per sample on average post-quality control processes, while paired-end metagenome sequencing yielded on average 1,547,826 reads at 150 bp per sample at 45% GC content, and with an average Phred score of 38. Weekly serum samples were also collected prior to phage administration, and 15, 30, and 60 min following a dose for qualitative PCR of the phages. End-point PCR of bacteriophage DNA concentrations in patient serum indicated the presence of the three AB-SA01 phages throughout treatment; concentrations peaked on day 29 pre-dose collection for each phages: J-Sa36 at 71.2 ng/PCR reaction, Sa83 at 166 ng/PCR reaction, and Sa87 at 10.8 ng/PCR reaction (Supplementary Table 5).",Corpora/bio/RA10-M2021.txt
"In an effort to contextualize microbiome data from a single patient, comparative analyses were computed using reference cohorts from the American Gut Project (AGP) [7]. Patient microbiome samples were analyzed in the context of the following cohorts: (i) healthy partici-pants from the AGP with no recent antibiotics, (ii) AGP participants with antibiotic exposure in the past week, and (iii) intensive care unit (ICU) participants [8]. The rationale for including healthy AGP and ICU partici-pants was to determine the spectrum of severity of dys-biosis in the patients microbiome.",Corpora/bio/RA10-M2021.txt
"First-order analyses revealed a clear separation of pa-tient samples according to body site as measured by un-weighted UniFrac distances [9] (Fig. 1a). The distinct grouping of patient microbiota within respective body sites is also supported by significant pairwise differences in community richness (Shannons index) between sam-ple types; however, there were no significant differences in community richness between nares and stool samples (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). Samples represent-ing gut and saliva microbiomes demonstrated low level variance in Shannons index score across the study, sug-gesting minimal collateral damage to community rich-ness in response to BT. Comparative microbiota analyses revealed phage-patient samples to be distinct from both ICU and AGP microbiomes; however, they tended to group with ICU samples (albeit not as ex-treme; Fig. 1c).",Corpora/bio/RA10-M2021.txt
"Longitudinal analyses, including pairwise distance cal-culations from baseline (pre-treatment) and mixed ef-fects statistical testing, of patient microbiome and metabolomes showed significant changes in axilla skin samples over time (Fig. 2a); the remaining sample types were relatively unchanged over time (Fig. 2a). Specific-ally, log-ratio calculations of the sub-operational taxo-nomic unit (sOTU) classified as Staphylococcus, and the highly proliferative skin commensal Corynebacterium demonstrated significant changes over time (P < 0.001), and within the phage treatment phase (P< 0.001) (Sup-plementary Figure 3A). Metabolites with opposing load-ings (refer to Supplementary data for biplot data) revealed significant (P = 0.03) temporal and phage treat-ment responses (Supplementary Figure 3B). Analysis be-tween the longitudinal rolling mean (window size of 6) of log-ratios of metabolite and microbes identified a temporal separation in profile (Supplementary Figure 4). Additionally, a list of key metabolites and their corre-sponding annotations based on spectral library matching in Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) are provided in supplementary material.

The base-line microbiome profile of the case patient at the start of BT was perturbed when compared to control AGP data-set but not as perturbed as the ICU data (Fig. 1c). This observation may be related to the fact that the patient had already been on systemic cefazolin for 2.5 months prior to BT and had been on prolonged courses of sys-temic antibiotics for more than a year. The severity of impact to the patient microbiome in response to pro-longed antibiotic exposure would have profound effects on microbial community composition relative to individ-uals whom have not taken antibiotics in the past year (AGP control). However, BT was self-administered as an outpatient; patient was not critically ill and received ad-equate enteral nutritionthis may explain why his microbiome profile was not as extremely perturbed as those patients in the ICU (Fig. 1c). We acknowledge that the AGP control samples may not be an optimal com-parison for our case patient; however, the comparison allows for semi-quantitative assessment of such a rare dataset. While our results suggest that IV phage therapy directed at S. aureus does not impact the gut microbiota in a single patient (Fig. 1), more research is required to better understand the true extent (e.g., leaky gut and translocation of bacterial metabolites through the blood circulatory system) of downstream collateral damage. For example, Hsu et al. [10]demonstratedin a mouse model that phage predation on target bacter-ial pathogens has cascading effects on the remaining microbial community members and consequences on the gut metabolome.

"We noted a significant decrease in staphylococci from axillary skin specimens during the course of BT, which we ascribe to the S. aureus-specific phages used for BT. Of note, we detected cefazolin in patient peripheral skin sites; as the patient had been on cefazolin for 2.5 months prior to BT initiation, we do not think that temporal change of staphylococci at this site is related to cefazolin use (Supplementary file). Figure 2a alludes to the select-ive specificity of AB-SA01 phages for staphylococci as the log-ratios between staphylococci and the highly pro-liferative skin commensal, Corynebacterium, changes sig-nificantly in time and during the phage-treatment phase; specifically, a decrease in Staphylococcus relative to Cor-ynebacterium was observed to be the key driver of mi-crobial shifts (Supplementary Figure 3A). Similarly, we observed significant changes in key metabolites over time (Supplementary Figure 3B) that correlate signifi-cantly with staphylococci (Supplementary Figure 4). However, the molecular mechanisms driving the chan-ging metabolite profile remain to be determined and warrant further investigation as phage therapy is more widely utilized; for example, the majority of metabolite features were unannotated, and given these are axilla samples, the changes could reflect the use of different",Corpora/bio/RA10-M2021.txt

"The need for non-antibiotic alternatives in treating in-microbiome, highlighting the unintended outcomes of fectious diseases is compounded by the detection of long-term antibiotic exposure. This implicates the host ecosystem as a reservoir of AMR that could present as a major risk factor for subsequent disease(s) and exacer-bate AMR transmission. While phages were detected by end-point PCR in patient sera samples to concentrations as high as 166 ng per PCR reaction (Supplementary Table 5), our shotgun metagenomic analyses were un-able to detect whole-genome nucleic acid material asso-ciated with the AB-SA01 phage genomes across patient microbiome samples. Serial S. aureus isolates were tested for phage sensitivity and there was no detectable resist-ance development (Supplementary Table 1); this further supports the viability of adjunct BT as a non-antibiotic alternative to treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infec-tions. Our microbiome analyses highlight several key considerations when implementing a multi-omics ap-proach to understanding phage therapy in clinical set-tings. For example, the depth of metagenomic sequencing required to quantitatively track temporal changes in phage abundance is cost prohibitive for rou-tine analysis and needs to be supplemented with quanti-tative PCR assays (in place of end-point PCR) targeting the conserved regions of the primase genes of the three AB-SA01 phages [12]. Future studies need to include whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial isolates; for example, WGS data from patients methicillin sensi-tive S. aureus isolate collected over a time-series could facilitate comparative genomics to track the succession of variant acquisition (e.g., single nucleotide polymor-phisms) in response to BT.

"Although we assessed only one patient in this study, the safety and efficacy of AB-SA01 was shown to have no adverse reactions (measured by host inflam-matory responses and clinical outcome) when treating 13 patients in an Australian hospital with severe S. aureus infections [12], as well as in a pilot trial for chronic rhinosinusitis [13]. Our report presents a proof-of-principle framework demonstrating that clin-ical use of S. aureus BT may have minimal collateral damage to the patientsmicrobiomeespecially the gut microbiome. This may be an important benefit vis a vis systemic antibiotics for treatment of infec-tions, as alterations in gut flora can be associated with multiple adverse events including Clostridiodes difficile colitis and increase in multidrug resistant or-ganisms.

"Although the composition and functional potential of the human gut microbiota evolve over the lifespan, kinship has been identified as a key covariate of microbial community diversification. However, to date, sharing of microbiota features within families has mostly been assessed between parents and their direct offspring. Here we investigate the potential transmission and persistence of familial microbiome patterns and microbial genotypes in a family cohort (n=.102) spanning 3 to 5 genera-tions over the same female bloodline. We observe microbiome community composition associated with kinship, with seven low abundant genera displaying familial distribution patterns. While kinship and current cohabitation emerge as closely entangled variables, our explorative analyses of microbial genotype distribution and transmission estimates point at the latter as a key covariate of strain dissemination. Highest potential transmission rates are estimated between sisters and motherCdaughter pairs, decreasing with increasing daughters age and being higher among cohabiting pairs than those living apart. Although rare, we detect potential transmission events spanning three and four generations, primarily involving species of the genera Alistipes and Bacteroides. Overall, while our analyses confirm the existence of family-bound microbiome community profiles, transmission or co-acquisition of bacterial strains appears to be strongly linked to cohabitation.",Corpora/bio/RA2-NM2022.txt

Assessing transmissibility of bacterial strains and determining whether they are passed on at birth or acquired only later in life will support the development of guidelines to facilitate or hamper trans-mission depending on their beneficial or risk profile, respectively1. Based on such a timeline and depending on whether the acquisi-tion of a specific strain should be considered a health benefit or rather a risk factor with respect to disease development, guidelines to facilitate/hamper transmission can be formulated1. Given reports of maternal inheritance of microbial strains2C5, strain sharing among individuals sharing households6 and transmission events spanning multiple generations in animal models7C9, similar considerations might apply when assessing the familial burden of conditions with a potential microbiota contribution, ranging from obesity10 to inflam-matory bowel diseases11.",Corpora/bio/RA2-NM2022.txt

"Microbiome variation in a multigenerational family cohort is associated with age. To explore the persistence of transmitta-ble microbial features across generations in the human host, we assembled a unique dataset of stool samples from women belong-ing to 24 multigenerational families living in the region of Flanders (Belgium) with accompanying metadata covering anthropomet-rics, delivery mode, cohabitation status, levels of systemic and local inflammation markers and use of medication (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). One hundred and two healthy individuals (aged 0C98, median =37.5, born between 1917 and 2016) were sampled between November 2015 and November 2016. The stan-dardized body mass indices (SBMI) of participants (an age- and sex-corrected version of the body mass index valid also in chil-dren12,13) varied between 7 and 56 (median =37) with most indi-viduals falling within the normal range (n =60 out of 87; normal range 30C39). Ninety-nine (n =99 out of 102) were born by vagi-nal delivery.

Hence, we confirmed that young children har-bour a markedly different microbiota when compared to individu-als with a fully matured colon ecosystem19,20.",Corpora/bio/RA2-NM2022.txt
"The Bacteroides2 enterotype is highly prevalent among young children. Recently, we identified a faecal microbiota community type with high prevalence in cohorts of individuals with obe-sity21, inflammatory bowel disease14,22 and primary sclerosing cholangitis22, as well as among individuals with certain subtypes of multiple sclerosis23 and depression24. Common features of this potentially dysbiotic Bacteroides2 (Bact2) enterotype include low compositional richness, low faecal cell counts and high and low proportional abundances of the Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium genera, respectively. In general, Bact2-enterotyped individuals present looser stools and higher (both intestinal and systemic) inflammation markers22. To distinguish community states within the present CGC, we performed Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) modelling25 against the background of microbiome varia-tion as observed in the Flemish Gut Flora Project (FGFP) dataset (n =1,106 population cohort)26. To this end and to preclude com-munity clustering driven by methodological differences, the CGC dataset was additionally profiled using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing following FGFP procedures26. The resulting amplicon profiles were only used for the purpose of enterotyp-ing. Applying probabilistic models to group samples potentially originating from the same community, DMM-based stratification reproducibly identifies microbiome configurations across datasets without making any claims regarding the putative discrete nature of the strata detected. Microbiomes were observed to stratify over four previously described enterotypes14, labelled as Bacteroides1 (Bact1), Bact2, Prevotella and Ruminococcaceae (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1). Bact2 samples diverged from their non-Bact2 counterparts, displaying lower microbial load (n =101, KruskalCWallis test, chi-squared =13.9, P =3.0 10.3; post-hoc Dunn test, Padj <0.05 for Bact2 versus Bact1/Prevotella), lower genus-level richness (n =101, KruskalCWallis test, chi-squared =20.0, P =1.6 10.4; post-hoc Dunn test, Padj <0.05 for Bact2 versus Bact1//Prevotell a/Ruminococcaceae) and higher stool moisture content (n =101, KruskalCWallis test, chi-squared =8.8, P =0.03; post-hoc Dunn test, Padj <0.05 for Bact2 versus Ruminococcaceae; Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). With only a single participant scoring above the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) clinical threshold (>15 mg l.1) and 11 above the faecal calprotectin one (>200 gg.1; Supplementary Table 1)27, we did not observe higher prevalence of systemic nor intestinal inflammation among participants host-ing Bact2 (n =77, chi-squared =1.8, P >0.05; n =99, chi-squared test =7.1, P >0.05) in contrast with previous reports regarding associations in specific patient groups22. Although enterotype strati-fication was not significantly associated with participants history of antimicrobial drug intake (n =95, chi-squared =5.0, P >0.05), low microbial load Bact2 samples were proportionally enriched in antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs; n =101, KruskalCWallis test, chi-squared =26.7, P =6.8 10.6; post-hoc Dunn test, Padj <0.05 for Bact2 versus Bact1/Prevotella/Ruminococcaceae; Fig. 1e and Supplementary Table 3). Enterotype distribution in the CGC cohort differed significantly from the proportions observed in the FGFP population cohort (n =101 versus n =1,106, chi-squared test =25.9, P =9.98 10.6), with the present dataset being characterized by a higher prevalence of Bact2 samples (29% versus 12%; pairwise chi-squared test =22.3, Padj =9.1 10.6; Supplementary Table 4). More specifically, young children (<4 years old) displayed a markedly higher prevalence of Bact2 configurations than observed both in the FGFP (90% versus 12%; n =10 versus 1,106, pairwise chi-squared test =48.7, Padj =1.2 10.11) and the 4+ CGC (90% versus 22%; n =10 versus n =91, pairwise chi-squared test =16.9, Padj =1.6 10.4; Fig. 1f and Supplementary Table 4).",Corpora/bio/RA2-NM2022.txt

"pants younger than 4 from these analyses, leaving us with an n =91 cohort (4+ CGC). Exclusion of young children resulted in family identifier being the sole significant microbiome covariate, account-ing for 14.7% of genus-level compositional variation (n =91, genus-level stepwise dbRDA, Padj =5.5 10.3; Supplementary Table 2 and Fig. 1c), exceeding the effects sizes of previously identified microbiome covariates26. Hence, we conclude that among women with a mature colon microbial ecosystem, family-bound phyloge-netic microbiome community patterns can be identified over mul-tiple generations. Remarkably, no such significant association with family was observed when assessing interindividual variation in abundance patterns of core microbial metabolic pathway modules28 (n =91, single dbRDA, P =0.23). These results are in accordance with the concept of a functionally redundant gut microbial eco-system28: while taxonomic profiles can vary substantially between individuals and even over time, taxa encode an overlapping core functional potential, ensuring stable interactions with the human host29. Of note, ARG abundance profiles also did not differ sig-nificantly between families in the 4+ CGC dataset (n =91, single dbRDA, P =0.27). Next, we zoomed in on specific microbiome features rather than community-level variation, capitalizing on the availability of quantitative microbiome profiling (QMP)-based, metagenome-derived genus abundances. We found that seven genera occurred in higher abundances among members of spe-cific families compared to the rest of the 4+ CGC cohort (n =91, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, .log10(P) >4.56; Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 5). While most of those family-associated gen-era could be qualified as low abundant (mean abundance <3 106 cells per gram of faeces, within 20% of the taxa with the low-est mean abundances in the dataset), 2 families were enriched in Pseudomonas (mean abundance =3.74 106), an opportunistic pathogen30, and Oxalobacter (mean abundance =3.74 106), linked to kidney stone risk reduction31, respectively. As a complementary approach, we assessed whether prevalence (presence/absence) of species or functions appeared family-bound across 4+ CGC genera-tions (non-random distribution in families across the cohort gene-alogy)32. None of the features evaluated (species, core functions and ARGs) were shared more frequently between related individuals than expected by chance in the cohort (n =91, genealogical index of familiality (GIF), Padj >0.05; Supplementary Table 6).",Corpora/bio/RA2-NM2022.txt

"The detection of familial microbiome community patterns does not necessarily reflect actual transmission of microorganisms across generations but could also result from shared genetic backgrounds and cultural transmission of lifestyle and dietary habits selecting for a similar microbial composition15,33. To infer potential exchange or co-acquisition of microbial strains between members of the same family, we recovered representative geno-types (consensus genetic sequences resulting from concatena-tion of marker genes with complete coverage) of species present with sufficient coverage in the unrarefied CGC faecal shotgun metagenomes using StrainPhlAn.

"Bacteroidales species display the highest potential transmission rates. While sharing of strains can result from co-acquisition of bacterial species, increased frequencies of shared strains have been suggested to be indicative for transmission between individuals36. In this study, based on the observed distribution of nGDs and opt-ing for the most stringent among previously suggested similarity thresholds2,5,37, we considered two genotypes to belong to the same strain when their nGDs <0.10 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4). This cut-off allowed us to identify 1,958 strains in the CGC cohort, with 213 of them (belonging to 40 species) being involved in a total of 870 potential transmission events (Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Table 10). Such events were observed to occur sig-nificantly less frequently among unrelated individuals compared to family members (IF =42.02% versus BF =12.87%; nIF =188 versus nBF =4,912 pairs of individuals, chi-squared test =125.87, P <2.2 10.16). Potential intrafamilial transmission events were detected for 35 out of the 51 species genotyped, together represent-ing more than 80% of the dominant genera in the gut microbiota (defined as the top 20% most abundant genera). To quantitatively explore these observations, we calculated potential transmis-sion rates (pTRs) within as well as across species as the number of transmission/co-acquisition events detected divided by the maximum possible transmissions in a family (defined as the com-binations of family members: maximum =nCr(n =n members, r =2)). Across species, average pTRs varied substantially between families (mean =2.75%, range 0C9.85%; Supplementary Table 13), putatively reflecting differences in familial interaction patterns or habits such as hygiene practices38. Within species, we observed the highest average pTRs for members of the order Bacteroidales (including Parabacteroides distasonis =11.11% (0C50%), Alistipes onderdonkii =9.58% (0C100%), Bacteroides faecis =8.75% (0C50%), Bacteroides caccae =8.61% (0C50%) and Bacteroides salyer-siae =8.33% (0C50%); Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 13), in line with reports on their frequent transmission from mother to off-spring5. To visualize IF strain sharing across the CGC dataset, we constructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the genotypes recovered within the cohort for each of the 35 spe-cies potentially transmitted between family members (Fig. 3d,e, Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 13). The highest numbers of potential IF transmission/co-acquisition events were detected for B. caccae and P. distasonis, shared between 15 and 14 pairs of individuals within 9 and 10 families, respectively (Fig. 3d,e).",Corpora/bio/RA2-NM2022.txt
"Both kinship and cohabitation are associated with higher poten-tial strain transmission. In the present dataset, kinship, cohabi-tation status and even ageall potential covariates of bacterial transmission frequencyemerged as closely related variables. For instance, 94% of participants under 30 years old reported living together with their mothers, with 96.3% of n >2 house-holds comprising a least 1 motherC<30-year-old daughter pair (Supplementary Table 1). While strain distribution was significantly associated with kinship (strain presence/absence microbiome pro-file variation, n =102, Mantel test, R2 =3.7%, P =6.5 10.3), only cohabitation had a significant non-overlapping effect size (stepwise RDA, R2 =8.1%, Padj =1.3 10.3; Supplementary Table 14). Within families, the highest pTRs were observed within sister (n =13 pairs, mean =5.17% (0C38.71%)) and motherCdaughter pairs (n =78, mean =3.99% (0C26.32%)). While pTRs spanning multiple genera-tions were markedly lower (n =49, mean =1.33% (0C10.71%) and n =19, mean =1.27% (0C7.9%) for pairs separated by 1 and 2 gen-erations, respectively), only the differences between two (motherC daughter) and three generations (grandmotherCgranddaughter) were identified as significant within the limitations of our cohort (n =102, KruskalCWallis test, chi-squared =10.99, P =1.18 10.2; post-hoc Dunn test, Padj =1.36 10.2; Supplementary Table 15). Both for sisters and motherCdaughter pairs, the pTRs calculated between pairs of individuals cohabiting were significantly higher than among their counterparts living apart (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, sisters, r =0.73, Padj =1.64 10.2; motherCdaughter pairs, r =0.47, Padj =1.56 10.4; Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 15), again indicative of cohabitation potentially promoting exchange of gut bacteria. However, overall, the pTRs for pairs of non-cohabiting family members was higher compared to non-related individu-als (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, r =0.24, P =5.85 10.5; Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 15). To gain a better understanding of the impact of cohabitation on strain sharing or potential transmission events, we reanalysed a family cohort assembled by Costea et al.39 consisting of 26 individuals belonging to 6 households (parents and offspring; Extended Data Fig. 6a). Applying the methodology described above, 43 species covering 498 strains were considered eligible for pTR analysis (Supplementary Table 17). Distinguishing between strains being shared among cohabiting related individu-als (mother/fatherCoffspring, n pairs =28) and between partners (fatherCmother, n pairs =6), we found that both categories exhibited higher pTRs than non-related, non-cohabiting individuals (n =26, KruskalCWallis test, chi-squared =105.65, P <2.2 10.16; post-hoc Dunn test, Padj <0.01; Extended Data Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 18), albeit with smaller effect and sample sizes for partners. Hence, while our analyses identified kinship as a key covariate of genus-level microbiota community differentiation, both CGC and the Costea et al.39 (re)analyses do not exclude cohabitation to be the driving factor in transmission or co-acquisition of individual microbiome features, which is in line with the findings of recent studies on gut ecosystem heritability40,41.",Corpora/bio/RA2-NM2022.txt
"Potentially reflecting the physical intimacy of their rela-tion, we detected the highest average pTRs between mothers and daughters in pairs comprising younger children, with frequencies steadily decreasing with age (n =78 pairs, beta regression, R2 =0.21, z =.3.87, P =1.11 10.4; Fig. 3g)an association again clearly linked to cohabitation, although the addition of this parameter did not significantly improve the correlation (R2 =0.24, model compari-son likelihood ratio test P =0.16). Also, among the species shared between mothers and young children, the largest pTRs were observed for Bacteroidetes, notably B. caccae (mean =57.14%), Bacteroides stercoris (mean =33.33%) and P. distasonis (mean =28.57%; Supplementary Table 16). Although our analyses did not allow to resolve directionality, with pTRs also reflecting potential transmis-sion from daughters to mothers42, our findings do not contradict the hypothesis of the maternal gut ecosystem being a contributor to primary succession events that constitute microbiota matura-tion processes in young children2,19. In this respect, given its low colonization resistance43, the immature nature of the infant and tod-dler microbiota can be expected to facilitate inclusion of exogenous microbiome features, acquired through both vertical and horizontal transmission or originating from environmental sources. Finally, we observed four strains belonging to the species A. onderdonkii (two strains), Alistipes shahii and B. faecis to be present in three consecu-tive generations in four families, potentially reflecting persistent niche colonization across generations (Extended Data Fig. 7). In addition, the strains of four other species were detected across three non-consecutive generations in three families. B. salyersiae and P. distasonis remained undetected in one of the intermediate levels, while a different strain of B. caccae and Eubacterium eligens were found at the grandmother level (Extended Data Fig. 7).",Corpora/bio/RA2-NM2022.txt
Conclusion,Corpora/bio/RA2-NM2022.txt
"Our explorative analyses of gut microbiota variation across gen-erations confirmed the microbiome of young children to be fun-damentally divergent from more developed configurations, with familial community structures only emerging on ecosystem matu-ration.

In line with these findings, we observed IF pTRs to decrease both with degree of kinship and age difference, with potential transmission events across generations being rare but detectable.

The BD Accuri CFlow software v.1.0.264.21 was used to gate and separate the microbial fluorescence events on the FL1/FL3 density plot from the faecal sample background. A threshold value of 2,000 was applied to the FL1 channel. To exclude any remaining background events, gated fluorescence events were evaluated on the forward/sideward density plot. Instrument and gating settings were kept identical for all samples (fixed staining/gating strategy44; Extended Data Fig. 8). Cell counts were converted to microbial loads per gram of faecal material based on the exact weight of the aliquots analysed. Measurements were performed in duplicate; if the number of events recorded differed by more than 10%, a third replicate was measured. One sample was excluded from cell counting due to insufficient faecal material to perform the measurements.

The resulting rarefied read counts were above 1.3 106 reads for all samples. Next, taxonomic classification of the rarefied reads into molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) was performed with MOCAT252 v.2.0.1 based on the abundances of the single-copy marker genes, with default parameters and skipping any filtering or trimming steps. mOTUs were then aggregated into species and genera using mOTU taxonomic annotation (mOTU. v1 database).

SUMMARY,Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"Activation of the innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is key to generate lasting adaptive immunity. PRRs detect unique chemical patterns associated with invading microorganisms, but whether and how the physical properties of PRR ligands in.uence the development of the immune response remains unknown. Through the study of fungal mannans, we show that the physical form of PRR ligands dictates the immune response. Soluble mannans are immunosilent in the periphery but elicit a potent pro-in.ammatory response in the draining lymph node (dLN). By modulating the physical form of mannans, we developed a formulation that targets both the periphery and the dLN. When combined with viral glycoprotein antigens, this mannan formulation broadens epitope recognition, elicits potent antigen-speci.c neutralizing antibodies, and confers protection against viral infections of the lung. Thus, the phys-ical properties of microbial ligands determine the outcome of the immune response and can be harnessed for vaccine development.",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

INTRODUCTION,Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"The dialogue between the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system is critical for protection against infections, as well as the pathogenesis of autoimmune, allergic, and infam-matory diseases (Banchereau and Steinman, 1998; Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004; Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002; Mat-zinger, 1994). Peripheral tissue infection and/or damage leads to the activation and migration of innate immune phagocytes to the draining lymph node (dLN), where they initiate an anti-gen-dependent adaptive immune response. Alternatively, innate stimuli or microbes with specifc physical properties (e.g., diameter in the nanometer range) can directly drain to the dLN and activate the lymph node (LN)-resident innate and adaptive immune cells (Bachmann and Jennings, 2010; Ir-",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"vine et al., 2020). The dLN has been thoroughly scrutinized for its capacity to host adaptive immune responses, but recent reports indicate that the antigen-dependent adaptive immune response is preceded and supported by an antigen-indepen-dent LN innate response (Acton et al., 2014; Coccia et al., 2017; De Giovanni et al., 2020; Didierlaurent et al., 2014; Kas-",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"tenmu ller et al., 2012; Leal et al., 2021; Lian et al., 2020; Lynn et al., 2015; Mart.n-Fontecha et al., 2004; Soderberg et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2018, 2019; Xu et al., 2015b). The LN innate response allows antigen-independent LN expansion, estab-lishment of a pro-infammatory milieu, and the development of an effective adaptive immune response (Acton and Reis e Sousa, 2016; Grant et al., 2020). It remainsa mysterywhether and how the LN innate response may differ when it is driven by the migration of phagocytes from the periphery, as opposed to when it is governed by the direct targeting of LN-resident innate immune cells.",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"Innate immune cells recognize pathogen-associated molecu-lar patterns (PAMPs) (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002) via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Brubaker et al., 2015). PRR activa-tion is critical for triggering infammation and for the ensuing development of adaptive immune responses. For this reason, targeting of PRRs has been harnessed for vaccine development (OHagan et al., 2020). Among PRRs, the biology of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and their potential as vaccine adjuvant targets have been less investigated.",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"CLRs control innate and adaptive immune responses to fungal infection through recognition of cell wall polysaccha-rides (Borriello et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2018). The CLRs Dectin-1 (Clec7a)and Dectin-2 (Clec4n)are activatedby b-glucans and mannans, respectively. These fungal polysac-charides vary not only by chemical structure but also by physical form (e.g., size and solubility). Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 bind fungal polysaccharides in soluble, as well as insoluble forms, but only the latter induces effcient receptor clustering and activation (Goodridge et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2013). Consequently, it is widely held that only particulate polysac-charides are immuno-stimulatory. In this study, we re-exam-ined this paradigm and show that the quality of LN innate and adaptive immune responses can be tuned by modulating the physical properties of fungal ligands, providing a promising approach for adjuvant design and vaccine development.",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

While soluble mannans did not induce skin infammation, these fungal ligands induced dLN expansion and lymphocyte accrual as early as 6 h post-injection (h.p.i.), which was sustained at 24",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"h.p.i. (Figure 1C; Figures S2ACS2C) and dependent on circulating leukocyte recruitment (Figure 1D). b-glucans also elicited LN expansion but only at 24 h.p.i. (Figure 1C; Figures S2ACS2C). Both fungal ligands increased the numbers of myeloid cells in the dLN (Figures S2DCS2G), with b-glucans preferentially increasing neutrophils, possibly refecting drainage from the skin (Figure S2D). However, only mannans induced the activation of myeloid cells, as measured by increased CD86 expression (Figure S2H). Considering the fast response and the diameter compatible with lymphatic drainage, we reasoned that mannans might activate LN-intrinsic circuits that eventually lead to dLN expansion. In keeping with this hypothesis, mannans rapidly accumulated in the dLN of wild-type (WT) and Ccr7/ mice in which migration of immune cells from the periphery (i.e., skin) to the dLNs is abolished (Figure 1E) (Ohl et al., 2004). Accordingly, mannans induced dLN expansion even in Ccr7/ mice (Figure 1F) A transcriptomic analysis of dLNs showed a completely opposite profle compared with the skin, with mannans eliciting an earlier and more pronounced response than b-glucans (Fig-",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

"depletion only partially affected LN expansion and cell accrual (Figure S2N). In keeping with this, IFNg blockade only partially reduced the mannan-induced expansion of LN (Figure 1J). We, therefore, tested whether the absence of both IFNg and type I IFN signaling impacted the LN innate response. Simultaneous blockade of both IFN types prevented mannan-elicited LN expansion and the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Figure 1J). This mechanism was not restricted to man-nans, since LN expansion and the induction of ISGs elicited by Lipo-CpG, a well characterized LN-targeted Toll-like receptor (TLR)9 ligand (Liu et al., 2014), were also impaired in Ifnar/ Ifngr/ mice (Figure 1K). To further establish whether these differences were due to the distinct physical forms of fungal polysaccharides, we evaluated the response to whole glucan particles (WGP) in dispersible (D) or soluble (S) forms, which have been characterized as Dectin-1 agonists and antagonists, respectively (Goodridge et al., 2011). Consistent with the pattern observed in mannans, WGP-S did not induce skin infammation (Figure S3A) but elicited LN expansion and ISG expression (Fig-",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

"riello et al., 2020; Lionakis et al., 2017; Netea et al., 2008) and its co-receptor FcRg were required for mannan-elicited LN expansion and ISG induction (Figure 2A). We employed fuores-cently labeled mannans and found that mannan-laden cells were CD45+ cells (Figure 2B). Imaging cytometry analysis confrmed that these cells internalized mannans (Figure 2C), and confocal microscopy analysis showed colocalization of phospho-Syk and mannans (Figure 2D), indicative of Dectin-2 and FcRg-medi-ated activation. Accordingly, mannan-laden cells showed the highest levels of expression of CD86 in an FcRg-dependent manner (Figure 2E). We found that more than 50% of mannan-laden cells were Ly6G (CD11b+ Ly6C+) CD11c+ cells, while less abundant cell subsets were neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6G+) and monocytes (-derived) cells (MoCs, Ly6G CD11b+ Ly6C+) (Figure 2F). The depletion of CD11c+ cells, but not the inhibition of monocyte egress from the bone marrow or the depletion of neutrophils, abolished the mannan-elicited LN innate response (Figure 2GC2I). CD11c+ cells can be further distinguished based on the expression of CD11b (Figure 2F). Since Dectin-2 is critical for mannan-elicited LN innate response, we assessed its expres-sion on CD11b CD11c+ and CD11b+ CD11c+ cells at steady state. Dectin-2 was expressed mainly by CD11b+ CD11c+ cells (Figure 2J). The majority of CD11b+ CD11c+ Dectin-2+ cells ex-pressed the subcapsular and medullary sinus macrophage marker CD169 (Figure 2K). Confocal microscopy analysis confrmed the colocalization of CD169 and Dectin-2 on cells lining the LN subcapsular sinus (Figure 2L). Furthermore, DT-mediated depletion of CD169+ cells in CD169-DTR mice phe-nocopied the results obtained with CD11c-DTR mice and completely abolished mannan-elicited LN expansion and ISG in-duction (Figure 2M). These results are consistent with a role for CD169+ sinus macrophages as sentinels of lymph-borne mate-rials (Moran et al., 2019).",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

Type-1 immunity has been associated with reduced risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease upon viral infection (Graham, 2020), and mannans formulated with alum promoted anti-Spike type-1 immunity by inducing anti-Spike IgG2c and antigen-specifc T cells skewed toward IFNg production (Figures 6AC6C). Elevated levels of anti-Spike IgG1 and IgG2c were maintained for up to 98 days post immunization (Figures S6A and S6B). Next, we performed a surrogate virus neutralization test and an actual SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test and found that mice immunized with Spike and mannans formulated with alum showed the highest degree of neutraliza-tion (Figures 6D and 6E). We also assessed whether there were spatial and temporal constraints to the adjuvant effect of mannans formulated with alum. Mice were injected with Spike and mannans formulated with alum at the same site, or with Spike formulated with alum at one injection site and with man-nans at an adjacent site, either on the same day or on the next day. An enhanced antibody response was observed only when Spike was admixed with mannans formulated with alum (Figures 6F and 6G). In contrast to B cell responses, IFNg production by antigen-specifc T cells was observed in mice immunized with alum and mannans, regardless of when and where mannans were injected (Figure 6H).",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

Notably, although fewer epitopes were recognized, the MERS Spike was also de-tected by antibodies elicited in mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and mannans formulated with alum (Figure 6I).

Increased anti-Spike and anti-RBD antibodies correlated with increased neutralization capacity compared with alum alone (Figures S7A and S7B). When mice were infected with the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10 strain (Leist et al., 2020), we found markedly reduced viral lung titers in mice immunized with mannans formu-lated with alum, AddaS03, or alum/PHAD compared with saline-treated or alum-immunized mice (Figure 7B).",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"The enhanced magnitude and breadth of the antigen-specifc antibody response elicited by mannans formulated with alum might be relevant for additional viral glycoproteins of high anti-genic variability, such as infuenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA). IAV is characterized by many strains within multiple sero-types, generating high subtypic diversity (Sangesland and Ling-wood, 2021). We reasoned that the mannan formulation might not only promote a robust antibody response against target an-tigens but also heterosubtypic immunity upon infuenza vaccine immunization. We employed the clinically relevant recombinant HA (rHA) vaccine Flublok, and immunized mice with Flublok alone or Flublok formulated with alum, mannans formulated with alum, Addavax, or alum/PHAD. Anti-rHA antibodies were signifcantly increased in mice immunized with rHA and mannans formulated with alum, AddaVax, or alum/PHAD (Figure 7C). We then challenged the mice intranasally with the IAV strain A/PR/ 8/1934, whose HA is not part of the Flublok vaccine, and found that only mice previously immunized with Flublok and mannans formulated with alum were signifcantly protected. These results correlated with high IgG levels against recombinant HA derived from A/PR/8/1934 (rPR8) in mice immunized with Flublok and mannans formulated with alum, but not the other adjuvant for-mulations (Figures 7DC7F and S7D).",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

DISCUSSION,Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"The activation of innate immune cells by PRR ligands is a critical step to initiate an adaptive immune response (Banchereau and Steinman, 1998; Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004; Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002; Matzinger, 1994). The study of cellular and mo-lecular events triggered by PRRs led to the identifcation of signaling organelles, metabolic pathways, and gene expression profles that shape the innate immune response (Brubaker et al., 2015). However, cell-intrinsic features of PRR activation and signaling alone do not explain the complexity of the in vivo in-fammatory response elicited by innate stimuli. Indeed, their localization at cellular and organismal levels plays a key role in determining the activation status of innate immune cells (Evavold and Kagan, 2019).",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"The study of CLRs, and specifcally of Dectin-1 and -2, is of particular interest since only the particulate form of their ligands induces effcient receptor clustering and activation (Goodridge et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2013). In our study, we show that soluble mannans, while largely inactive in vitro and in vivo at the injection site, traffc to the LN due to their size and elicit a potent innate response, characterized by LN expansion and expression of type I and II IFN transcriptional programs. Remarkably, the re-sponses that we observed bypass the need for dendritic cell migration from the periphery to the dLN, and soluble mannans directly target CD169+ sinus macrophages. We further modu-lated the physical properties of mannans by adsorbing them onto alum to obtain formulations in which mannans are present in both soluble and particulate forms. We show that this formu-lation results in enhanced immunological properties, such as full activation of innate immune cells in vitro and simultaneous targeting of the periphery and the LN. When tested as an adju-vant system formulated with viral glycoprotein antigens (IAV HA or SARS-CoV-2 Spike), mannans enabled induction of neutralizing antibodies with broad epitope specifcity.

"A key aspect of our work is the requirement for both type I and II IFNs to sustain mannan-induced lymphocyte accrual and LN expansion. Also, IFNs are necessary to potentiate the induction of antigen-specifc antibodies. IFNs act on both myeloid cells and LN stromal cells where they modulate a range of functions, including chemokine expression and vascular permeability (Bar-rat et al., 2019; Ivashkiv, 2018). Hence, our results raise the pos-sibility that mannan-elicited IFN signatures affect LN-resident myeloid and stromal compartments, eventually leading to poten-tiated adaptive immune responses. Our data on the augmented production and epitope specifcity of the anti-Spike antibody and data on the induction of cross-reactive anti-A/PR/8/1934 HA-an-tibodies suggest that the IFN signature driven by mannans formulated with alum broadens epitope recognition and potenti-ates protection against viruses. Nevertheless, in the future, it will be important to assess a possible innate training effect pro-moted by a more potent IFN response that may yield to cross-protective innate immunity.",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"Mannans formulated with alum acquire remarkable new immunological properties. Although we cannot exclude synergy between alum and mannans, our results are more readily ex-plained by the concurrent presence in the formulation of man-nans unbound to alum and alum-adsorbed mannans. The former is responsible for ISG expression in the dLN, while the latter me-diates skin infammation. Evaluation of mannans formulated with alum in our immunization model with SARS-CoV-2 Spike sup-ports this model. Direct synergy between alum and mannan in-fammatory activity was excluded when alum and mannans were injected separately but in close physical proximity, an approach that led to a loss of the capacity of these adjuvants to enhance anti-Spike IgG. Such loss did not apply to T cell-mediated responses, which were boosted by the presence of mannans, independently of their coformulation with alum. Anal-ysis of soluble mannans that are either formulated or not with alum and admixed to Spike also showed that both formulations induce humoral and cellular type 1 immunity. Early induction of type I and II IFN signatures in the dLN is therefore suffcient to explain polarization of the adaptive immune response. Transient disruption of type I/II IFN signaling by administration of blocking antibodies signifcantly decreased levels of anti-Spike IgG, sug-gesting that early IFN signatures in the dLN translate into long-term potentiation of the immune response.",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"A remarkable property of the formulation of mannans and alum is its ability to induce neutralizing anti-Spike antibodies with broad epitope specifcity. These antibodies cross-react with the SARS-CoV Spike and, to a lesser extent, the MERS Spike. The epitope specifcity profle observed in mice immunized with alum and mannans is comparable to that observed in COVID-19 patients, highlighting the translational relevance of our results (Shrock et al., 2020). Production of these antibodies has the same molecular and cellular requirements as the LN innate reaction induced by mannans formulated with alum, with the sole excep-tion of cDC1 that play an important role in driving the IgG response but not the LN innate response. Neutralizing antibodies are important for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in an-imal models (Cao et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Lv et al., 2020; McMahan et al., 2021; Rogers et al., 2020; Scha fer et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020). Accord-ingly, mice immunized with Spike and mannans formulated with alum show undetectable lung viral titers after infection with SARS-CoV-2 MA10, similar to mice immunized with clinically relevant adjuvant formulations. We then employed a model of infuenza vaccination, using the clinically relevant Flublok vac-cine. While all adjuvants tested enhanced the antibody response to Flublok, only mannans formulated with alum induced hetero-subtypic immunity that was paralleled by detection of antibodies that cross-react against HA of A/PR/8/1934. It will be important in the future to clarify how the formulation of mannans and alum modulates germinal center dynamics and B cell repertoire selec-tion. From a translational perspective, the broadening of epitope specifcity suggests that mannans formulated with alum in combination with appropriate antigens might be a promising candidate for the development of vaccines that target multiple coronavirus or infuenza A strains.",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

"response. Also, it will be important to unravel the possible rela-tionship between NK cells and DCs. Another unexpected fnding is the only partial requirement of CARD9, the key signaling adaptor downstream of Dectins (Borriello et al., 2020; Brubaker et al., 2015). CARD9-independent pathways downstream of Dec-tins have also been described, including NIK-dependent activa-tion of the non-canonical NFkB subunits p52 and RelB (Gringhuis et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2018). Mice that lack NIK, p52, or RelB have profound defects in secondary lymphoid organ development (Sun, 2017). Our results show that RelB activation in CD11c-ex-pressing cells regulates mannan-induced LN expansion and expression of type I IFN-dependent ISGs and cooperates with CARD9 in modulating the expression of type II IFN-dependent ISGs. Although the role of RelB in modulating IFN responses and ISG expression is ambiguous (Le Bon et al., 2006; Saha et al., 2020), and more studies will be required to decipher its role upon mannan encounter, our fndings create an intriguing parallelism between LN development and the innate response, setting the stage for RelB as a central regulator of the biology of secondary lymphoid organs.",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

Isolation of mannan from C. albicans,Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt
"For mannan isolation, C. albicans was inoculated into 15 l of YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) and grown for 20 hours at 37C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 minutes. This resulted in a 100 g pellet from 15 l of media. We used a standard protocol for isolation and NMR characterization of the mannan (Kruppa et al., 2011; Lowman et al., 2011). In brief, the cell pellets were suspended in 200 ml of acetone to delipidate the cells for 20 minutes prior to centrifugation at 5000 g for 5 minutes, removal of acetone and drying of the pellet for an hour. Dried pellets were broken up and transferred to a tissue ho-mogenizer. An equivalent volume of acid-washed glass beads was added and 200 ml of dH2O was added to the mixture. The cells were subjected to bead beating for three 30 second pulses before the entire mixture was transferred to a 1 l fask. The material was autoclaved for 2 hours, allowed to cool and then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 5000 g. The supernatant was retained and the cell pellet discarded. Pronase (500 mg in 20 ml dH2O), which had been flter sterilized and heat treated for 20 minutes at 65C (to remove any glycosidic activity) was added to the supernatant along with sodium azide to a concentration of 1 mM. The mixture was then incu-bated overnight (20 hours) at 37C to allow for degradation of any proteins in the solution. Mannans were extracted by addition of an equal volume of Fehlings solution to the protease treated mannan solution and allowed to mix for one hour at room temperature. After mixing the solution was allowed to stand for 20 minutes to facilitate mannan precipitation. The supernatant was decanted and the precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of 3M HCl, to enable release of copper from the reducing ends of the mannans. To the dissolved mannan solution 500 ml of an 8:1 mixture of methanol:acetic acid was added, and the mixture stirred to allow the mannan to precipitate overnight. After the material had settled, the supernatant was decanted, washed again with 500 ml of methanol, allow-ing six hours for the mannans to settle. The supernatant was decanted and the remaining precipitate was dissolved in 200 ml dH2O. The mannans were dialyzed against a 200-fold change of dH2O over 48 hours using a 2000 MW cutoff membrane to remove residual acid, methanol and other compounds from the extraction process. The dialysate was then subjected to lyophilization and stored at -20C until needed. A small sample (10 mg) of the material was subjected to NMR to confrm for the purity of the N-linked mannans (Lowman et al., 2011) and for assessment of molecular weight (Kruppa et al., 2011). Prior to in vitro or in vivo use the mannan is de-pyrogenated to remove any residual endotoxin and flter sterilized.",Corpora/bio/RA3-Cell2022.txt

SUMMARY,Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"Given the immense antigenic load present in the microbiome, we hypothesized that microbiota mimo-topes can be a persistent trigger in human autoim-munity via cross-reactivity. Using antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a model, we demonstrate cross-reactivity between non-orthologous mimotopes expressed by a common human gut commensal, Roseburia intestinalis (R. int), and T and B cell autoe-pitopes in the APS autoantigen b2-glycoprotein I (b2GPI). Autoantigen-reactive CD4+ memory T cell clones and an APS-derived, pathogenic monoclonal antibody cross-reacted with R. int mimotopes. Core-sequence-dependent anti-R. int mimotope IgG titers were signi.cantly elevated in APS patients and corre-lated with anti-b2GPI IgG autoantibodies. R. int immu-nization of mice induced b2GPI-speci.c lymphocytes and autoantibodies. Oral gavage of susceptible mice with R. int induced anti-human b2GPI autoantibodies and autoimmune pathologies. Together, these data support a role for non-orthologous commensal-host cross-reactivity in the development and persistence of autoimmunity in APS, which may apply more broadly to human autoimmune disease.",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
INTRODUCTION,Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"Commensal microorganisms chronically colonize host barrier sites and impact a broad range of human physiology (Cho and Blaser, 2012). Commensal-host interactions with the mucosal and systemic immune systems have evolved over millennia (OHara and Shanahan, 2006). Microbial antigens are continu-ously sampled by the mucosal immune system and presented to adaptive immune cells that can mount local and systemic responses (Hand et al., 2012; Hegazy et al., 2017; Ladinsky et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2016). Commensal-host immune interactions are implicated in the development of autoimmunity via bystander activation, cross-reactivity, dual antigen recep-tors, and epitope spreading (Ost and Round, 2018; Ruff and Kriegel, 2015). Because the particular antigens presented by innate immune cells to antigen-specifc T cells are dictated by polymorphisms in major histocompatibility (MHC) genes, host-commensal cross-reactivity may contribute to the development and persistence of human autoimmunity in genetically predis-posed individuals. Given the enormous antigenic load of the human gut microbiome, which is encoded by over 9.8 million non-redundant genes (Li et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2010), we hypothesized that chronic exposure of the gut immune system to non-orthologous, commensal mimotopes generates and sus-tains human autoimmune disease via cross-reactivity.",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"We utilized antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a model of systemic autoimmunity with well-characterized autoepitopes to test for commensal mimotope cross-reactivity. The common autoantigen b2-glycoprotein I (b2GPI), also known as apolipopro-tein H, is targeted in the majority of APS patients (Ruiz-Irastorza et al., 2010). It contains fve domains and circulates at high levels in human plasma (Lozier et al., 1984; Polz and Kostner, 1979). T cell-dependent autoantibodies against b2GPI lead to autoim-mune clotting events and obstetric complications (Garcia and Erkan, 2018; Giannakopoulos and Krilis, 2013). Widespread thrombotic events can be lethal and occur also in patients with other systemic rheumatic diseases such as lupus (Garcia and Er-",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"kan, 2018; Giannakopoulos and Krilis, 2013; Rauch et al., 2018). A thoroughly characterized CD4+ T cell epitope in domain V (DV) of b2GPI is p276-290 (KVSFFCKNKEKKCSY), which is restricted by the human leukocyte antigen polymorphism HLA-DRB4*0103 (serotype DR53) (Arai et al., 2001; Kuwana et al., 2005). The major B cell autoepitope resides in domain I (DI) of b2GPI, the arginine-rich R39-R43 (RGGMR) sequence, and is strongly asso-ciated with thrombosis (de Laat et al., 2005, 2006; Ioannou et al., 2007; Iverson et al., 1998; Mahler et al., 2016; Pericleous et al., 2015). Focusing on commensals with mimotopes to both T cell (p276-290) and B cell (R39-R43) epitopes within b2GPI, we identifed the prevalent, immunogenic human gut commensal Roseburia intestinalis (R. int) as a cross-reactive trigger in APS patients. We provide in vitro and in vivo evidence supporting T and B cell cross-reactivity between human b2GPI autoepitopes and R. int mimotopes. We show that human, gut-tropic, b2GPI-reactive memory CD4+ Th1 cell clones cross-react with R. int and mimotope peptides. Further, an APS-derived, pathogenic autoepitope-specifc antibody binds to a mimotope in a bacterial DNA methyltransferase expressed by R. int (R. int DNMT). Consistent with these fndings, APS patients have signif-icantly elevated levels of anti-R. int DNMT IgG, which positively correlate with anti-b2GPI IgG and are dependent on the core sequence based on mutagenesis studies. Moreover, immuniza-tion of BALB/c mice with R. int induces autoepitope-specifc cross-reactivity to human b2GPI. Finally, oral gavage of R. int into the spontaneous APS mouse model, (NZW x BXSB)F1 mice, induced signifcantly elevated anti-human b2GPI IgG autoantibodies and thrombotic events. These proof-of-concept studies support cross-reactivity between non-orthologous commensal mimotopes and autoepitopes in genetically suscep-tible individuals as a potential mechanism sustaining chronic autoimmunity in humans.",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt

"We aligned the HLA-DRB4*0103 (DR53)-restricted b2GPI-immu-nodominantCD4+T cellepitopep276-290(KVSFFCKNKEKKCSY) (Arai et al., 2001; Kuwana et al., 2005) and the major APS B cell autoepitope in b2GPI, R39-R43 (RGGMR) (de Laat et al., 2005; Ioannou et al., 2007; Iverson et al., 1998) to bacterial proteins in non-redundant protein databases (Altschul et al., 1990). Candidate sequences were cross-referenced to identify human commensal gut bacteria containing homology to both of these well-defned T and B cell autoepitopes. Excluding pathogens that are expected to represent mainly transient stimuli, we identifed R. int as a common, human colonic bacterium contain-ing proteins with highly homologous amino acid sequences to the CD4+ Tcell b2GPI-immunodominant epitope p276-290 (GenBank: EEU99424.1) in DV and the core region (R39-R43) of the major B cell autoepitope in DI of b2GPI (NCBI Reference Sequence: WP_118597735.1) (Figure 1A). Further, the B cell mimotope was predicted by in silico modeling to be exposed, indicating a potential antibody-binding site within R. int DNMT (Figure 1B).",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"We enrolled 15 subjects positive for persistent moderate-to-high-titer b2GPI IgG autoantibodies (11 APS patients and 4 indi-viduals at risk for APS, defned as APS hereafter) and 20 healthy donors (defned as normal healthy donors [NHD] hereafter). Study subjects donated fecal samples, whole blood, and plasma at up to three longitudinal visits separated by 1 month each to capture microbial and immune marker variability over time. Health status, medications, 24-h diet histories, and APS-relevant HLA and auto-antibody status were collected over time (Tables 1 and S1).",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"To determine overall gut microbial community structure, sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) V4 region was per-formed on fecal DNA (Cullen et al., 2015; Kozich et al., 2013). Compared to NHDs on average and across time, overall taxon-omy, alpha diversity as measured by Shannon-Weiner diversity index, and beta diversity as measured by principal-coordinate analysis of weighted UniFrac distances were not different in APS patients (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1ACS1E). Similarly, the rela-tive abundance of Roseburia at the genus level was not signif-cantly different in APS patients (Figure S1F), supporting its broad prevalence in human gut microbiomes. Next, we determined IgA coating of the gut microbiota using fuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). IgA coating varied across time (Figure S1G) with a trend toward being increased in APS patients compared to NHDs (Figure S1H). Furthermore, sorting of IgA-coated frac-tions followed by 16S rRNA sequencing, so called IgA-seq (Palm et al., 2014), was performed on a limited cohort. IgA-coated fractions differed in taxonomy with signifcantly lower alpha diversity and different beta diversity in APS patients compared to NHDs (Figures 1E, 1F, and S2). IgA coating of the genus Roseburia was not different by IgA-coating index (ICI) (Fig-",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"ure S3), but this method does not capture species-specifc alter-ations in IgA coating. Using R. int species-specifc qPCR primers (Figure S4A), R. int was detected in 13 of 15 APS patients and positive in 86.7% (n = 44) of all visits. Similarly, R. int was present in 18 of 20 healthy donors and positive in 88.6% (n = 48) of all visits (Figure S4B). These data support that while gut microbial community structure is not signifcantly different in APS compared to NHD, gut mucosal IgA targets are contracted in APS patients and that R. int is widely prevalent in the gut micro-biome of our cohort.",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"We next examined if subclinical intestinal and corresponding systemic infammation is present in APS patients, with the hypothesis that the contracted mucosal IgA response may asso-ciate with a more pronounced systemic IgG response toward certain gut microbiota. Using the surrogate fecal marker of infammation, calprotectin (Berstad et al., 2000; Konikoff and Denson, 2006), and a marker of intestinal-associated systemic infammation, lipocalin-2 (Chassaing et al., 2012; Vijay-Kumar et al., 2010), we compared signs of infammation between APS and NHD. For fecal calprotectin measurements, we excluded individuals taking proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-infammatory drugs because these interventions are associ-ated with increased fecal calprotectin levels (Poullis et al., 2003; Tibble et al., 1999). Fecal calprotectin was signifcantly elevated in APS compared to NHD and did not change across time within individuals (Figures 1G and S4C). Moreover, plasma lipocalin-2 was signifcantly elevated in APS patients and did not differ across time (Figures 1H and S4D). These data support that chronic, subclinical intestinal and peripheral infammation is pre-sent in APS patients, possibly allowing for cross-reactive im-mune responses to commensal bacteria to spread systemically.",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt

"To test autoantibody cross-reactivity, we cloned two APS-derived, lupus anticoagulant (LA)-inducing autoantibodies, pre-viously demonstrated to bind to b2GPI DI, as full-length human IgG1 antibodies (Dienava-Verdoold et al., 2011; Pelkmans et al., 2013). Clone P1-117 binds to a discontinuous DI-DII epitope containing the major R39-R43 epitope, whereas clone P2-6 binds to an unrelated DI epitope outside of the R39-R43 sequence (Dienava-Verdoold et al., 2011; Pelkmans et al., 2013). We confrmed P1-117 DI interaction by ELISA and bio-layer interferometry (Figures 3Aand S6ACS6C). Supporting cross-reactivity of an R39-R43-specifc mAb with R. int,we found that P1-117, but not P2-6, bound to R. int lysates similarly to serum from mice immunized with R. int (Figure 3B). Finally, we show that P1-117 bound to the R. int DNMT mimotope compared to a mutant version with RGGMR substituted with al-anines (R. int DNMTD122-126)(Figures 3Cand S6D). To confrm the specifcity of these interactions using bio-layer interferom-etry, we screened recombinant human insulin (rhInsulin) as an unrelated human autoantigen, which is typically employed in polyreactivity assays (Tiller et al., 2007).

"patients had signs of subclinical intestinal infammation together with peripheral adaptive immune recognition of R. int. The latter was refected by circulating anti-R. int antibodies polarized to the IgG isotype, indicating a mature, class-switched B cell response to R. int in APS patients compared to controls. APS CD4+ mem-ory T cells, specifc for the HLA-DRB4*0103-restricted b2GPI epitope p276-290, cross-reacted with a mimotope derived from R. int and had a Th1-like phenotype. Moreover, we demon-strated that an APS-derived monoclonal antibody with LA activ-ity exhibits pathogenic features by functionally impairing human trophoblasts. We were able to show that this functional mAb, which targets the pathogenic DI epitope R39-R43, bound to both R. int lysates as well as the mimotope within the R. int pro-tein DNMT. Ex vivo, APS patient plasma also bound to the mimotope within R. int DNMT, a fnding that positively correlated with anti-b2GPI IgG autoantibody titers. Finally, we also demon-strated T and B cell cross-reactivity in vivo with progression to full-blown clinical disease in a genetically susceptible back-ground. These fndings support a role for R. int-mediated cross-reactivity in the development and maintenance of patho-genic autoantibodies in genetically predisposed individuals. In non-predisposed individuals, commensal mimotopes likely provide a source of antigen-specifc tolerance in homeostatic settings. This hypothesis is partially supported by a recent study showing that commensal-specifc diabetogenic T cells are re-cruited to the gut and were capable of suppressing colitis (Heb-",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"bandi Nanjundappa et al., 2017). In a genetically predisposed host, this mechanism of tolerance may break down and support the induction and maintenance of pathogenic autoreactive lym-phocytes. Additional insults act then as a tipping point that allow for pathogenic cross-reactivity to progress to tissue damage and overt autoimmune pathology. These data are consistent with the current second hit hypothesis in APS, which states that additional environmental hits, such as oxidative stress or lipo-polysaccharide (LPS), lead to acute thrombotic events following systemic anti-b2GPI responses in vivo (Agar et al., 2011; Fischetti et al., 2005; Laplante et al., 2011).",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"Following this model, exposed, cross-reactive epitopes on gut commensals, that naturally turn over in the gut and release immunogenic antigens such as DNMT, may induce autoanti-bodies against the unexposed, cryptic epitopes in b2GPI years before a second, innate immune-driven event occurs (second hit hypothesis). Such second hits then lead to exposure of the cryptic epitopes within b2GPI, which facilitates binding of pathogenic autoantibodies to b2GPI DI and subsequent throm-botic episodes. This scenario is plausible given the immense antigenic variability of the microbiota and the various second hits that can occur in humans such as oxidative events during stress or trauma, a burst of LPS in the circulation during gram-negative infections, exposure of phospholipids during excessive apoptosis or viral infections (Giannakopoulos and Krilis, 2013; Passam et al., 2011; Ruff et al., 2015). The gut microbiota likely contributes also to these second hits if one considers that phos-pholipids, LPS, or oxidative stress can also be derived from com-mensals. This is particularly likely in the setting of heightened gut infammation, as we noted in APS patients, or a disturbed gut barrier present in a spontaneous model for lupus-related APS (Manfredo Vieira et al., 2018).",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt
"In summary, a complex interplay between antigen-specifc responses against chronically colonizing commensals in a hu-man host together with a genetic predisposition and intermittent second hits from the environment are likely drivers of persis-tent autoreactive T and B cells with subsequent waves of tissue damage. Defning the molecular interactions between the host immune system and the microbiota will be essential for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic immune dis-eases. This study dissected a molecular process of host-micro-biota interactions in the multistep pathogenesis of APS that may be applicable more broadly to other autoimmune diseases. In addition, similar processes may apply to microbiota effects on antitumor immunity, where a cross-reactive tissue-directed host response would be desirable (Routy et al., 2018). Evolu-tionarily, commensal cross-reactive immune responses may be tolerated by the host to allow for tumor surveillance and enhanced pathogen clearance under infammatory conditions. The trade-off would be a heightened risk of developing and sus-taining autoimmunity in susceptible individuals as we have demonstrated here.",Corpora/bio/RA4-CHM2019.txt

SUMMARY,Corpora/bio/RA5-CHM2022.txt
"Testosterone de.ciency can lead to depressive symptoms in humans; however, the causes of this de.ciency are incompletely understood. Here, we isolated Mycobacterium neoaurum from the fecal samples of testos-terone-de.cient patients with depression and showed that this strain could degrade testosterone in vitro. Furthermore, gavaging rats with M. neoaurum reduced their serum and brain testosterone levels and induced depression-like behaviors. We identi.ed the gene encoding 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3b-HSD) as the enzyme causing testosterone degradation. Introducing 3b-HSD into Escherichia coli enhanced its ability to degrade testosterone. Gavaging rats with 3b-HSD-producing E. coli reduced their serum and brain testos-terone levels and caused depression-like behaviors. Finally, compared with 16.67% of participants without depression, 42.99% (46/107) of the fecal samples of patients with depression harbored 3b-HSD, and 60.87% (28/46) of these fecal samples expressed 3b-HSD. These results suggest that 3b-HSD expressed by gut mi-crobes may be associated with depressive symptoms due to testosterone degradation.",Corpora/bio/RA5-CHM2022.txt

SUMMARY,Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt
"Free-living mammals, such as humans and wild mice, display heightened immune activation compared with ar-tifcially maintained laboratory mice. These differences are partially attributed to microbial exposure as labora-tory mice infected with pathogens exhibit immune profles more closely resembling that of free-living animals. Here, we examine how colonization by microorganisms within the natural environment contributes to immune system maturation by releasing inbred laboratory mice into an outdoor enclosure. In addition to enhancing dif-ferentiation of T cell populations previously associated with pathogen exposure, outdoor release increased circulatinggranulocytes.However,theserewilded micewerenotinfectedbypathogenspreviouslyimplicated in immune activation. Rather, immune system changes were associated with altered microbiota composition with notable increases in intestinal fungi. Fungi isolated from rewilded mice were suffcient in increasing circu-lating granulocytes. These fndings establish a model to investigate how the natural environment impacts im-mune development and show that sustained fungal exposure impacts granulocyte numbers.",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"The house mouse is the most prevalent mammalian model organism used in biomedical research and has enabled funda-mental advances in basic immunology. Yet, this ubiquitous model fails to recreate certain aspects of human immunity. Inbred laboratory mice and adult humans differ in the proportion of leukocyte subsets, transcriptional responses to microbial challenges, and other immune parameters (Masopust",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"2018). In contrast to approaches that rely on catching wild mice, our experimental system allows us to control genetics and the timing of environmental exposure by releasing lab-bred mice into a natural environment. We can thus systematically compare genetically de.ned mice maintained outdoors with control mice of the same genotype kept in a con-ventional animal facility. Another key feature of the enclosure is that a zinced iron wall excludes predators and rodents harboring disease-causing infectious agents, while allowing exposure to natural soil, vegetation, and weather. Mice rewilded through transient release into the enclosure acquire a bacterial microbiota characterized by increased diversity and display heightened susceptibility to helminth infection (Leung",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"2020), we describe deep immune pro.ling of rewilded mice to identify a series of changes that occur to the immune system upon exposure to the natural environment and apply computational analyses to infer the impact of genetic and environmental variables. Here, we tested the hy-pothesis that colonization by microorganisms present in the natu-ral environment contributes to the maturation of the immune sys-tem that occurs in free-living mammals. We found that rewilded mice display an increase in central and effector T cells, similar to pet store mice infected with pathogens. We also identi.ed an addi-tional featurean increase in granulocyte populations in the blood and lymph node. These changes were not associated with path-ogeninfection but, instead,wereassociated withan altered gut mi-crobiota characterized by a substantial increase in fungi. Coloniza-tion of lab mice with the model fungus Candida albicans or fungi isolated from rewilded mice recreated the expansion of granulo-cytes. These .ndings implicate fungi and other members of the gut microbiota in the maturation of the immune system and sug-gest that differences between lab mice and humans are due, in part, to the lack of colonization by environmental microbes.",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

Fungi Isolated from Rewilded Mice Induce Granulocyte Expansion in Lab Mice,Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt
"C. albicans represents a useful model and is relevant to human disease, but its utility may be limited because it is unlikely to be representative of fungi acquired in the outdoor enclosure. Having determined that exposure to the natural environment leads to a large increase in fungal burden, we wished to compare the precise composition of the fungal microbiota of rewilded and lab mice. Fungal sequences represent a minor proportion of shotgun sequencing reads because of the dominant presence of bacteria. To address this issue, we performed ITS sequencing of stool to increase our resolution of fungal taxa. We found that the fungal microbiota of rewilded and lab mice segregated by PCA (Figures",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt
"7A and S7A). In contrast to the bacterial micro-biota, we found that rewilding was associated with an increase in a-diversity of fungi detected (Figure",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"Finally, we examined whether fungi acquired in the outdoor enclosure are capable of driving changes to granulocyte numbers that we observed in rewilded mice. We were able to isolate many of the fungi corresponding to the taxa identi.ed in the ITS sequencing reads when we plated stool from rewilded mice on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Figure",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

DISCUSSION,Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"2016), whereas 90% of mice released into our outdoor enclosure were recovered at the end of the 6C7 week period, with several of the stragglers success-fully trapped thereafter (all together, >95% recovery). Compre-hensive serology indicated that rewilded mice were not infected by the pathogens detected in pet store mice, although we acknowledge the possibility that agents not covered by the assay may be present, and that our rewilded mice were likely exposed to pathobionts that can cause disease in immunocom-promised mice, such as those included in the PCR panel. Consistent with the minimal infection by disease-causing patho-gens, visual inspection and handling of rewilded WT mice indi-cated that they were healthy and that their movements were sharper and muscles stronger than the lab control mice. Thus, our outdoor enclosure system may be useful for identifying immunomodulatory microbes that are dif.cult to isolate from wild or pet shop mice that have a more complex infectious history. We suggest that controlled release into nature can complement other approaches that expose mice to the natural environment and that each method has its strengths and weaknesses.",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt
"The most striking effect of rewilding that we identi.ed was the expansion of granulocytes in the blood including neutrophils. This .nding is notable because granulocytes are abundant in hu-man blood and scarce in laboratory mice. Hence, we were eager to identify the environmental variables that drive granulocyte expansion. The microbiota of rewilded mice was characterized by a signi.cant increase in total fungi that included acquisition of Aspergillus species. The transfer of total microbiota including bacteria and fungi from rewilded mice into germ-free mice was able to reproduce the increase in granulocytes. Still, the propor-tion of blood granulocytes in reconstituted germ-free mice was lower than that of rewilded mice, potentially due to the poor engraftment of fungi.

"Our results do not rule out a role for bacteria and other agents acquired in the wild. For instance, it is possible that an immuno-genic bacterial species was not successfully transferred to germ-free mice upon reconstitution, leading us to miss an impor-tant contribution of the bacterial microbiota. An intriguing and perhaps likely possibility is that bacteria and fungi conspire to mediate the full effect of rewilding. An important future direction would be to identify interactions between the fungi we isolated and the bacterial microbiota. Similarly, other environmental vari-ables may contribute to our observations in rewilded mice. In addition to initiating microbial exposure, eating vegetation and burrowing in the dirt could lead to continuous re-exposure or provide nutrients to the microbiota (Budischak",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"We also had an opportunity to determine the contribution of two IBD susceptibility genes. Neither Atg16l1 nor Nod2 mutation had a noticeable effect on the leukocyte populations we measured. Interestingly, Atg16l1 mutant mice that served as the lab controls displayed a large increase in fungal burden. Although unclear if related, a subset of the rewilded Atg16l1 mutant mice displayed diarrhea. We previously demonstrated that Atg16l1 and Nod2 mutant mice develop small intestinal de-fects in a manner dependent on speci.c commensal-like agents and that close relatives of these agents do not trigger any abnor-malities (Cadwell",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"In conclusion, our results indicate that fungi are among the different infectious entities that mammals encounter in the natu-ral environment and represent one of the missing or altered com-ponents of the microbiota in lab mice kept under SPF conditions. Microbes, vegetation, and climate vary across the globe, and it is likely that exposure to nature has a different consequence de-pending on the location. Nevertheless, the recent study charac-terizing wildings noted that wild mice, when compared with lab mice, indeed display increased colonization by Ascomycota, the phylum that includes the Aspergillus species we found in our rewilded mice (Rosshart",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"al.,",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt
"2019). Therefore, exposure to fungi may not be unique to our experimental system, and it remains possible that this fungal exposure drives the altered im-munity observed in other studies examining wild or pet shop mice. When taken together, the .ndings we present here expand our understanding of the immunomodulatory role of intestinal microbes and indicate that a diverse fungal microbiota, likely together with the bacterial microbiota, participates in the differ-entiation of the immune system in a free-living mammal.",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

All animal work was approved by NYU Langone IACUC (#IA16-0087 and #IA16-00864). All mouse lines were bred onsite in an MNV/ Helicobacter-free speci.c pathogen free (SPF) facility at NYU School of Medicine to generate littermates from multiple breeding pairs that were randomly assigned to either remain in the institutional vivarium (lab mice) or released into the outdoor enclosures (rewilded,Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"The enclosures consist of replicate outdoor pens, each measuring about 180 m2 and fenced by 1.5-m high, zinced iron walls that are buried >80 cm deep and topped with electrical fencing to keep out terrestrial predators. Aluminum pie plates are strung up to deter aerial predators. A (180 3 140 3 70 cm) straw-.lled shed is provided in each enclosure, along with two watering stations and a feeding station, so that the same mouse chow used in the laboratory (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20) was provided ad libitum to all mice. Mice outdoors, however, also had access to food sources found within the enclosures, including berries, seeds, and insects. 26-30 mice of mixed genotypes but the same sex were housed in each enclosure for 6-7 weeks. Longworth traps baited with chow were used to catch mice approximately 2 weeks and 4 weeks after release and again 6-7 weeks after release; for each trapping ses-sion, two baited traps were set per mouse per enclosure in the early evening, and all traps were checked within 12 h. For subsequent microbiome assessment, a fresh stool sample was collected directly from the caught mice, .ash frozen on dry ice, and stored at 80C until further analysis. Mice were weighed with a spring balance.",Corpora/bio/RA6-CHM2020.txt

"Bacterial blight of rice is an important disease in Asia and Africa. The pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), secretes one or more of six known transcription-activator-like effectors (TALes) that bind specific promoter sequences and induce, at minimum, one of the three host sucrose transporter genes SWEET11, SWEET13 and SWEET14, the expression of which is required for disease susceptibility. We used CRISPRCCas9-mediated genome editing to introduce mutations in all three SWEET gene promoters. Editing was further informed by sequence analyses of TALe genes in 63 Xoo strains, which revealed mul-tiple TALe variants for SWEET13 alleles. Mutations were also created in SWEET14, which is also targeted by two TALes from an African Xoo lineage. A total of five promoter mutations were simultaneously introduced into the rice line Kitaake and the elite mega varieties IR64 and Ciherang-Sub1. Paddy trials showed that genome-edited SWEET promoters endow rice lines with robust, broad-spectrum resistance.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt

"anthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is the etiological agent of bacterial blight disease in rice. The disease is most severe in southeast Asia but is increasingly damaging in west African countries, and results in substantial yield loss1. TALes from Xoo are injected by a type III secretion system into plant cells and rec-ognize effector-binding elements (EBEs) in cognate SWEET host gene promoters, which results in induction of SWEET genes and production of sugars that enable disease susceptibility in rice2,3. An array of central repeats, which are 34C35 amino acids long, are pres-ent in each TALe and interact with EBEs via two repeat variable di-residues (RVDs) at the 12th and 13th position of each repeat4,5. Aberrant repeats, longer than 35 amino acids, are hypothesized to allow looping out of the repeat to accommodate alternate sequence binding for a particular TALe6. Bacterial blight depends on TALe-mediated induction of at least one member of a family of sugar-transporter genes. Although rice has more than 20 SWEET genes, only those of clade III are reported to be induced by Xoo7C10. Although all five of the known clade III SWEET genes in rice can function as susceptibility genes for bacterial blight, only three are known to be targeted in nature10. More specifi-cally, SWEET11 expression is induced by strains encoding the TALe PthXo1, SWEET13 by PthXo2 and SWEET14 by any one of several TALes, namely AvrXa7, PthXo3, TalC and TalF (originally Tal5) 7,9C15 (Table 1). Effectors of Xoo that target clade III SWEET genes are referred to as major TALes owing to their strong virulence effect.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"Naturally occurring resistance has arisen as the result of nucleo-tide polymorphisms in EBEs of SWEET promoters. EBE alleles of SWEET11 that are not recognized by PthXo1 are collectively referred to as the recessive resistance gene xa13. Rice varieties con-taining xa13 are resistant to strains that solely depend on PthXo1 for SWEET induction. Most indica rice varieties carry a SWEET13 allele that contains four adenines in the EBE for PthXo2, and rice lines carrying this allele are susceptible to PthXo2-dependent strains12. A rare exception is the recessive resistance allele xa25, which con-tains three adenines in the EBE for SWEET13 in the indica cultivar Minghui 63, conferring resistance to strains that depend solely on PthXo216. A similar recessive resistance allele in japonica rice vari-eties is equally effective against strains relying on PthXo2 (ref. 12). Additional naturally occurring recessive EBE polymorphisms that confer resistance to strains carrying PthXo2, and the overlapping EBEs for PthXo3, TalF and AvrXa7 have subsequently been identi-fied in the promoters of SWEET13 and SWEET14, respectively, in germplasm collections17,18.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"Rice susceptibility genes are good targets for genome editing for disease resistance. TALe-mediated susceptibility is particu-larly modifiable. For instance, transcription-activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-directed mutations in SWEET14 created lines resistant to strains carrying PthXo3/AvrXa7 (refs. 19,20). Importantly, characterization of TALes and their cognate EBEs indicates that a limited set of EBEs are targeted by extant Xoo populations. At the",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt

Diversity of TALes in 63 Xoo strains,Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"An assessment of the diversity of the major TALes in extant strains of Xoo was obtained by analyzing Xoo genome sequence data and virulence assays on rice lines with SWEET promoter poly-morphisms. TALe gene content was derived from an analysis of complete genome sequences of 33 strains from Asia (XooS) and 30 strains from Africa (XooF), which were either in databases or newly sequenced (Supplementary Table 1). Whole-genome, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based parsimony trees clearly sep-arated XooS from XooF genomes, revealing two distinct evolution-ary lineages (Fig. 1). Trees based on alignments of repeat regions of 856 TALes revealed two major clusters (Supplementary Fig. 1). Expansion and diversification of TALe loci were more frequent in XooS (18C21 TALes per genome) than in XooF genomes (nine TALes per genome). Expansion and diversification of TALe loci is also reflected by the number of SWEET-gene-inducing TALes, of which there are 13 variants (unique RVD sequences) in XooS strains and three variants in XooF strains (Supplementary Fig. 2).",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"TALes predicted to induce SWEET genes (major TALes) were present in all Xoo strains, regardless of origin (Fig. 1). Indeed, all strains possessed one or more close homologs of the known major TALe groups (PthXo1, PthXo2 and PthXo3/AvrXa7). PthXo3/ AvrXa7 is treated as a single class owing to the closely overlapping EBEs in the SWEET14 promoter. Asian strains had approximately equal numbers of PthXo2 (targeting SWEET13) and PthXo3/ AvrXa7 (SWEET14) (24 versus 23, respectively; Fig. 1). Most Asian strains had multiple major TALes with a combination of PthXo2 with either PthXo3 or AvrXa7 (Fig. 1). None of the strains con-tained both PthXo3 and AvrXa7 (Fig. 1). In African lineages, the two known major TALes of Xoo are TalC and TalF, which each induce SWEET14 using non-overlapping EBEs10,13. Half of the analyzed African strains had both TalC and TalF, while none had TalF alone (Fig. 1). Overall, we found six non-overlapping EBEs in three SWEET promoters, if we treat the EBEs of PthXo2 variants that occur in some rice varieties as a single EBE (Table 1). These results support the hypothesis that activation of SWEET genes was a critical evolutionary step that occurred independently in different geographic regions during Xoo adaptation to rice.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
Diversity of TALes from infection trials,Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"To estimate the prevalence and variation of TALes in geographically diverse Xoo strains, a collection of 105 Xoo strains was screened against the japonica rice variety Kitaake and derivative Kitaake lines carrying mutations in the three SWEET genes normally targeted by TALes. Kitaake contains a natural variant allele of SWEET13 that is not recognized by PthXo212. Strains were also screened against lines with alternate alleles of SWEET11 and SWEET14 generated by TAL effector nucleases (TALEN) both singly and in combination (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2).",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"Ten of 105 Xoo strains were not virulent on the japonica refer-ence line Kitaake. These ten strains were virulent on an indica refer-ence line IR24 (Supplementary Fig. 3). IR24 contains few known resistance genes and serves as a recurrent susceptible parent line for breeding diverse near-isogenic resistance gene lines against bacte-rial blight25. These strains may be solely dependent on PthXo2 for induction of the IR24 indica allele of SWEET13, as the EBEs in the other SWEET gene promoters are the same in Kitaake and IR24. Alternatively, Kitaake may have a resistance gene that is effective against the ten strains. These ten strains were excluded from further screening.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"Of the remaining 95 Xoo strains, 18 were not virulent on edited rice line 1, which is defective in the EBE targeted by PthXo1 in SWEET11, and 69 strains were not virulent on line 5, which is defec-tive in the EBEs of AvrXa7 and PthXo3 within SWEET14 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). Eighty-seven strains (18 +69) were also not virulent on line 52-1, which harbors mutant alleles of both SWEET11 and SWEET14, while the remaining eight strains (95 C",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"87) were virulent on line 52-1 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). These findings indicate that 87 strains from the screen rely on major TALes that target known EBEs of SWEET11 and SWEET14, whereas eight deviant strains have different virulence abilities and, presumably, different TALes. These eight strains originated from the Philippines (PXO61, PXO364, PXO404, PXO421 and PXO513), the Korean peninsula (JW89011 and KXO85) and the African con-tinent (AXO1947) (Supplementary Table 2).

However, on the basis of similarity of the RVDs, all seven genomes had one of two variant pthXo2-like genes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). One variant, named PthXo2B, is present in all five strains from the Philippines, while PthXo2C is present in the two Korean strains. All three PthXo2-related effectors have repetitive domains of 22 RVDs. PthXo2B differs in eight RVDs, while PthXo2C con-tains seven variant RVDs as compared to PthXo2 (Supplementary Fig. 4a).

In addition to differences in the RVDs, PthXo2B and PthXo2C have 36-amino-acid repeats at RVD 9 and 12 relative to PthXo2. Atypical repeats have been found to accommodate alternative EBE binding in the major TALe AvrXa7 (ref. 6).

"Xoo strains with PthXo2 alone are incompatible on Kitaake-derived lines owing to the inability to induce the japonica allele of SWEET1312. The presence of pthXo2B or pthXo2C could explain the virulence phenotypes of the seven deviant strains on Kitaake and the double-edited Kitaake line 52-1. Both effectors are pre-dicted to enable induction of the japonica allele of SWEET13. To test this possibility, the candidate gene for PthXo2B from PXO61 was cloned and introduced into strain PXO99AME2 (hereafter ME2), which is not pathogenic on any of the tested rice lines owing to a null mutation in the sole major TALe gene pthXo1 of PXO99A (ref. 9).

Discussion,Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"We set out to evaluate our hypothesis that editing known SWEET EBEs will endow rice with broad resistance to bacterial blight. The success of our approach depended on extant Xoo strains fitting the profile of the relatively few Xoo strains that have been geneti-cally characterized. Indeed, analysis of a broad collection of 63 Xoo strains found that all strains targeted, or were predicted to target, SWEET11, SWEET13 and SWEET14, as previously reported8,10,27. Furthermore, most Xoo strains, if not all, target some combination of six short EBE sequences present in the promoters of the three SWEET genes. We applied multiplexed CRISPRCCas9 genome editing to systematically interfere with SWEET gene induction at all known major TALe EBEs and engineer Kitaake rice resistant to all currently known strains of Xoo. Kitaake is an excellent cultivar for proof-of-concept owing to high regeneration and rapid flower-ing cycle. The lines generated here will serve as diagnostic tools for rapid evaluation of the virulence of novel Xoo isolates24. Although Kitaake can be used for breeding resistance genes into Japanese and Chinese varieties, the japonica cultivar is not optimal as breed-ing material in large parts of southeast Asia and Africa, which use mainly indica varieties. Therefore, we also applied the same editing approach in two mega varieties, IR6426 and Ciherang-Sub128. The edited mega variety lines grew normally, without yield suppression,",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt

The experiment was repeated twice independently.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
and were resistant to three representative strains of bacterial blight carrying the known major TALes.,Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"To devise an efficient genome editing strategy it was important to identify a panoply of TALes and cognate EBEs to guide engi-neering of broadly applicable bacterial blight resistance. Sequence analysis of the seven deviant Xoo strains from Asia and relatedness of TALes with close, but not identical, RVDs led us to propose that variants of PthXo2 target variant EBEs in SWEET13. These seven Asian strains retained virulence on the first-generation of genome-edited EBE lines in the Kitaake background, indicating that the vari-ant strains either carry another major TALe targeting an undefined susceptibility gene or a variant major TALe targeting SWEET11, SWEET13 or SWEE14 at an alternate EBE. The two newly identified pthXo2 members (pthXo2B and pthXo2C) were predicted to target the SWEET13 promoters found in many japonica varieties, includ-ing Kitaake and Nipponbare. Indeed, PthXo2B conferred virulence to ME2, a strain lacking major TALe genes, on both Kitaake and Nipponbare, concomitantly with SWEET13 induction. Thus, the presence of PthXo2B or PthXo2C in the deviant strains is sufficient to explain their virulence on the TALEN-edited lines. Ultimately, several lines with CRISPR-mediated edits at the PthXo2B-cognate EBE of Kitaake were resistant to pthXo2B-containing strains, indi-cating that the Kitaake allele for SWEET13 was responsible for the susceptibility of line 52-1. Recent testing of all TALe genes of the strain PXO61 did not reveal any new major TALe other than PthXo3 and PthXo2B29. XooS strains carrying PthXo2B were obtained in the Philippines, where several bacterial blight outbreaks occurred. This sublineage is characterized as local races 1 and 9d, which have not been reported in other countries. At the same time, the Philippine archipelago may offer a safe geographic reservoir for less prevalent strains. Both strains from the Korean peninsula possess PthXo2C. The sampling of Korean strains was limited, and we are unable to state whether genes for PthXo2C are the rule or the exception. What is clear is that different variants of PthXo2 family are present in the",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt

"African strains were shown to possess less TALe diversity and fall into two sublineages. All strains harbor the major virulence TALe, TalC, which targets SWEET14. Members of the second sublineage have TalC and TalF, the latter also targeting SWEET14. Another fea-ture of the African strains is that loss of TalC function results in significantly reduced lesion length13. Xoo strains relying solely on TalC retained full virulence on Kitaake lines mutated in the TalC EBE within SWEET14 (ref. 19).",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"We show here that mutation of the TalC EBE in the promoter of SWEET14 in Kitaake led to only moderate resistance to the African strain AXO1947. By contrast, double knock out of SWEET13 and SWEET14 resulted in complete resistance24. Consistent with previ-ous studies19,30, the dependence of African Xoo strains on SWEET gene expression to cause symptoms appears more complicated than anticipated. Alternatively, lesion length may not be strictly cor-related with ecological fitness or disease severity, and variation in lesion length, particularly at lower value ranges, may be due to vari-ant host defense responses to diverse pathogen lineages.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"Broad resistance to bacterial blight at the SWEET promoters will not prevent adaptation of the pathogen, and the durability of this approach will depend on the ability of Xoo populations to adapt to recessive resistance alleles. As noted, TALe genes have limited diversity, and, when diversity is present, it comprises minor varia-tions. We propose that creating polymorphisms that are larger than a single nucleotide change (ideally modifying the whole EBE) in the EBEs of SWEET genes is advisable. These changes will still capture minor TALe variants of the major, for example, for PthXo2 and AvrXa7/PthXo3. The promoter editing will also likely thwart TALe adaptation, assuming that ease of adaptation to new binding sites is inversely related to the number of novel nucleotides in the tar-get sequence. EBEs must meet certain structural requirements for TALe binding within the available sequences of the susceptibility gene promoters. Another consideration is that breeders will likely combine these recessive resistance alleles with other locally effective resistance genes and these combinations will likely severely reduce disease pressure, further delaying strain adaptation.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"A diagnostic kit that can both identify the promoter variants best suited to defeat the local pathogen population and monitor vari-ant strain emergence is presented in an accompanying publication24. Breeders and pathologists can work together to provide selected lines to farmers, with an overall strategy of deploying multiple lines in a region to disfavor the evolution of novel strains.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"Multiplex targeting using CRISPRCCas9 has created the ability to simultaneously edit all EBEs present in any single rice line. However, this method is limited owing to the constraint of possible edits and problems with the delivery of editing complexes. For example, the most efficient genome editing is via DNA-mediated delivery, which confers regulatory concerns on edited plants. Genome editors such as CRISPRCCpf1 (also called Cas12a, which allows for larger muta-tions), potent ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery and transgene-free genome editing may mitigate these limitations and improve the durability of disease resistance.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"In conclusion, by using a combination of systematic analyses of diverse Xoo strains, an understanding of SWEET genes and genome editing, we were able to engineer broad-spectrum resistance in Kitaake and two mega varieties IR64 and Ciherang-Sub1. Genome editing can result in off-target effects and the transformation pro-cess often leads to mutations and somaclonal variation31,32, but on- and off-target analysis of rice genomes in NCBI with the Cas9 guide RNAs revealed that all the predicted off-target sites lack PAM sequences (an essential component for Cas9 recognition) and con-tain mismatches larger than 4 nucleotides to the guide sequences within the single guide RNA (sgRNA) genes (Supplementary Table 8). Furthermore, off-target mutations (if they are present), and other mutations derived from tissue culture and the regeneration process, will be eliminated in crosses during breeding. Full genome sequencing will be needed to identify possible off-target mutations and to ensure that the lines do not contain any T-DNA. Finally, our preliminary analysis of agronomic traits, while promising, is insuf-ficient for direct deployment. Extensive field trials will be necessary to ensure performance of these edited resistant lines.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt

"Generation of rice mutant lines. Agrobacterium strains containing the respective CRISPR constructs were used for genome editing in Kitaake, IR64 and Ciherang-Sub1. Individual transformants were selected, propagated and regenerated into whole plants (T0) as described44,45. Leaf tissues collected from individual samples were homogenized in liquid nitrogen, and genomic DNA was isolated following the CTAB method. Initial screening for transformants (T0) was done via PCR of the phosphotransferase transgene (hpt) with primers HptF and HptR. Nuclease surveyor assay using Cel1 enzyme was employed in T0 plants to preselect lines with possible sequence alterations in the target regions. We selected 20 mono- and biallelic events for IR64 and sequenced the EBE regions using site-specific PCR amplicons obtained with primer pair 8NKpI-F5 and 8N3-R for SWEET11, primer pair 12N3-F1 and 12N3-R1 for SWEET13 and primer pair 11N3-F2 and 11N3-R for SWEET14. To detect the CRISPR transgenes, paired primers OsCas9-F and OsCas9-R were used for Cas9, primers g8N3-F and g12N3-R for gRNA genes targeting SWEET11 and SWEET13, and primers g11N3-F and g11N3-R for gRNA genes targeting SWEET14. These primer pairs were also used for selection of candidate mutant lines in the advanced generations (T1 to T2). Primer information is provided in Supplementary Table 9. Nineteen gRNA-gene-free and Cas9-free IR64 T1 plants were selected and further analyzed. Thirty plants for each of the 19 IR64 T2 lines were phenotyped for resistance to Xoo strains PXO339, PXO99 and PXO86, and target promoter regions of the candidate lines were sequenced to confirm mutations. Seeds of T2 plants were bulked (from 30 plants per line), phenotyped for Xoo resistance and analyzed for agronomic traits as described below. Seeds from 13 individual T3 plants were advanced to T4 on the basis of three criteria: (1) mutation type, (2) consistent resistance to the three Xoo strains and (3) seed count. For Ciherang-Sub1, we obtained seven independent transformation events. Eighteen Cas9-free T1 plants were further analyzed for resistance and amplicon sequencing as described above up to the T3 generation.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"Evaluation for agronomic traits of the rice mutant lines. We expected that mutant lines would show potential changes in agronomic traits owing to disruptive expression of the SWEET genes, off-target mutations across the genome or somaclonal variation. To assess the performance of the selected mutant lines, four agronomic characters in IR64-IRS1132 and Ciherang-Sub1-IRS1132 lines were assessed under paddy screenhouse conditions in a randomized block design experiment with three replications. At maturity, the plant height, panicle length, percentage of reproductive tillers (number of tillers with panicle/total number of panicles per plant) and percentage fertility (number of filled grains/total number of grains) were measured.",Corpora/bio/RA7-NB2019.txt
"Disease assays. Fully expanded leaves of rice plants (6C8 weeks old) were inoculated using a leaf-tip clipping method. Xoo stocks, preserved in a .80 C freezer, were streaked out on TSA plates supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and incubated at 28 C for 2C4 d. The cells were harvested from the plates and resuspended in sterilized distilled water (optical density at 600 nm of 0.5, ~108 colony-forming units per milliliter). Scissor blades were immersed in Xoo suspension and used to clip about 2 cm from the leaf tip. The lesion lengths were measured 14 d after inoculation. Lesions were measured from each test plant. Lesion length measurements 5 cm were scored as resistant (R), 6C10 cm as moderately resistant (MR), 11C14 cm as moderately susceptible (MS) and 15 cm as susceptible (S).

Abstract,Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"Background: Threats of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to human health are on the rise worldwide. Airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5), especially those emitted from hospitals, could serve as a substantial yet lesser.known envi-ronmental medium of inhalable antibiotic resistomes. A genome.centric understanding of the hosting bacterial taxa, mobility potential, and consequent risks of the resistomes is needed to reveal the health relevance of PM2.5.associated AMR from clinical settings.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"Results: Compared to urban ambient air PM2.5, the hospital samples harbored nearly twice the abundance of anti-biotic resistantance genes (ARGs, ~ 0.2 log10(ARGs/16S rRNA gene)) in the summer and winter sampled. The profiled resistome was closely correlated with the human.source.influenced (~ 30% of the contribution) bacterial community (Procrustes test, P < 0.001), reflecting the potential antibiotic.resistant bacteria (PARB), such as the human commen-sals Staphylococcus spp. and Corynebacterium spp. Despite the reduced abundance and diversity of the assembled metagenomes from summer to winter, the high horizontal transfer potential of ARGs, such as the clinically relevant blaOXA and bacA, in the human virulent PARB remained unaffected in the hospital air PM samples. The occurring pat-terns of .lactam resistance genes and their hosting genomes in the studied hospital.emitting PM2.5 were closely related to the in.ward .lactam.resistant infections (SEM, std = 0.62, P < 0.01). Featured with more abundant poten-tially virulent PARB (2.89 genome copies/m3.air), the hospital samples had significantly higher resistome risk index scores than the urban ambient air samples, indicating that daily human exposure to virulent PARB via the inhalation of PM2.5 was ten times greater than from the ingestion of drinking water.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"Conclusions: The significance of AMR in the studied hospital.emitting PM2.5 was highlighted by the greater abun-dance of ARGs, the prevalence of potentially virulent PARB, and the close association with hospital in.ward .lactam infections. A larger.scale multi.source comparison of genome.resolved antibiotic resistomes is needed to provide a more holistic understanding to evaluate the importance of airborne AMR from the One.Health perspective.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt

"remain unchanged [2, 3]. A quintessential One.Health issue, AMR can be developed, transmitted, and prevail in the environment via multiple pathways, thereby con-stituting an integral dimension of the human-animal-environment loop [4, 5]. In comparison with soil, water, and waste [6], AMR materials in ambient air are more pervasively and closely interconnected with human beings [7]. In particular, AMR associated with airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exacerbates this health issue because PM2.5 can penetrate deeply into the alveo-lar region and even enter the bloodstream [8, 9]. Inhaled antibiotic.resistantance genes (ARGs) have been found to expose human beings to a concentration of 102C3 cop-ies/m3-air [10], and their pathogenic bacteria hosts.could increase the chances of resistant infections through air inhalation. The enduring existence of inhalable ARGs, together with human pathogens like Streptococcus pneu-monia (0.05%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (5.8% of the whole microbiome), has been detected in severe PM2.5 pollution days [11]. These airborne particles accommo-date dynamic compositions of microbes originating from a variety of emission sources (e.g., human feces and hus-bandry waste) due to mechanic agitation, wastewater aeration, and biosolid aerosolization [12]. The pathogens therein included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotropho-monas maltophilia, and Talaromyces marneffeiin. Inha-lation of these pathogens as part of airborne particles may lead to an increased risk of respiratory infections [12C14].",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"The profiles of airborne ARGs are generally impacted by the features of their emission sources and atmos-pheric conditions [14]. Compared to other heavily AMR-laden environments (e.g., feedlots, sewage treatment works, landfill sites) [15C17], clinical settings are gener-ally characterized by the more intensive use of frontline antibiotics and frequent occurrence of human bacterial pathogens [18, 19]. These issues are particularly relevant to large urban hospitals in fast-developing countries, where the overuse of antibiotics is commonplace [20], and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and patient overcrowding conditions are reportedly severe [21]. In one study focusing on the clinical settings [22], bioaero-sol concentrations were found to be higher in the inpa-tient areas (115  13 cfu/m3) than in other sites (80  7 cfu/m3), and some human opportunistic pathogenic commensals (e.g., Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp.) were observed in the bioaerosols of inpatient wards and other public areas of hospitals. These airborne bac-teria associated with inhalable particles (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10) that are (potentially) virulent to humans can be transmitted from the air to the human respiratory sys-tem via inhalation [23C26]. Moreover, mobile genetic ele-ments (MGEs) in the air can facilitate the dissemination of ARGs to airborne bacteria via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [7]. Hence, the co-existence of airborne ARGs, MGEs [27C29], and bioaerosols [22] from clinical sources may facilitate the movement of potential antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARB) in the airborne particles emit-ted from hospitals. This situation should be systemically studied.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"PM2.5-associated ARGs have been detected at compar-atively higher levels in air samples close to hospitals than to other urban areas (0.4 vs. 0.1 ARGs/16s rRNA gene in relative abundance) [27], implying that hospital-emitted air particles may be the main contributors to ARGs in the bioaerosol matrix. However, little is known about (i) the genome-centric profile of resistomes, HGT potentials, and associated virulence; (ii) linkages with hospital ward AMR infection cases; and (iii) AMR risk levels relative to other environmental settings and exposure pathways. Moreover, to date, metagenomic sequencing and relevant analyses on air samples, especially on ambient airborne PM2.5 [30], have yet to be systematically conducted. As such, to address these key scientific issues, PM2.5 sam-ples emitted from a large urban hospital were collected. In the meantime, the datasets concerning HAI cases and antibiotic consumption from the hospitals administra-tion department were retrieved for this study. The most accessible metagenomic sequencing datasets were also obtained from urban ambient airborne PM2.5 and drink-ing water, which were compiled with the hospital sam-ples to characterize the resistome and hosting bacterial taxa and to explore the AMR health risks across different environments and exposure pathways.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt

"A high-volume PM2.5 sampler (ASM-1, Mingye Inc. China) was set upon the ventilation outfalls on the rooftop of the inpatient building of a large urban hos-pital in Guangzhou, China (Supplementary Infor-mation; Additional file.1: Fig..S1). The sampling ventilation outfalls are connected with the vent pipes linking to the inpatient zones and emergency rooms of Department of Pulmonology and Critical Care Medi-cine. The emitted bioaerosols from these places are expected to contain typical human-associated airborne microbiomes and can better represent the air-trans-mission health risks with clinical relevance. On the one hand, it may reflect what is in the inpatient zone with nosocomial airborne transmission. On the other hand, it may also link to what the neighboring community could be exposed to as a potential AMR source. This hospital well.known for its pulmonology medicine serves more than 150,000 inpatients annually, which is typical for a large municipal public hospital in China.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"Ambient air was drawn at an average flow rate of 1 m3/ min for 24 h (10:00 AM to 10:00 AM) per sampling day, corresponding to approximately ~ 1500 m3 of air flow-through per sampling day. The PM2.5 sampling campaign was conducted in two separate periods in the year 2019: June to August (summer, n = 10) and late September to December (winter, n = 9). Two to three samples were collected on a weekly basis in each sampling month. In addition, ambient air PM2.5 sam-ples collected from Guangzhou city (Tianhe (TH) and Conghua (CH) Districts) from April 2016 to May 2017 (same sampling procedure to the hospital samples, n = 10) were used for an urban comparison study in the present research. The sampling date of all samples was provided in Additional file1 (Table.S1). All the filters were sterilized by baking in a Muffle furnace at 500 C for 5 h prior to sampling. Each sterilized filter was packaged in sterilized aluminum foil and stored in a humidity-controlled chamber until being loaded into the filter cartridge.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"The collected PM2.5 filters were packaged in the steri-lized aluminum foil and zip bags and were immediately transferred to the lab in an ice box. The pretreatment of filter samples followed the previously published pro-tocol with modifications [31]. Half of the A4-size filter was sonicated with sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The particulates that were deposited in PBS-extract aliquots were filtered through a PES membrane disc-filter (0.2 m  47 mm, Supor 200, PALL Co., USA).

"The filtered clean reads were grouped by sampling periods/seasons (SI-Additional file.1: Table.S1) and were co-assembled using MEGAHIT v1.13 with default parameters [34]. These co-assembled contigs were clustered to recover metagenomes using Max-Bin, metaBAT, and CONCOCT [35C37] by using MetaWRAP (v1.3.2, contig length  1000 bp) [38]. The assembled bacterial genomes were further refined to produce high-quality individual genomes using the built-in refining module of MetaWRAP, with the selec-tion criteria of > 50% completeness and < 5% contami-nation. Following that procedure, all metagenome data were refined to remove redundant assemblages and then were annotated for taxonomic classifications by using the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB; v1.4.0) [39]. To analyze the potential sources of the bacteria loaded on the air PM2.5 samples, 16S rRNA sequences were extracted from metagenomic reads by using SortMeRNA (version 2.1b) [26]. The silva-bac-16s-id90.fasta and Greengenes 13.8 99_otus.fasta databases were used with Cfastx Cpaired_in -blast 1 -num_alignments 1 parameter settings. Extracted 16S rRNA sequences were then analyzed by QIIME2-vesearch (v2020.11) using a closed reference against Greengenes 13.8 to generate operational taxonomic unit (OTU) tables for all of the tested samples (identity cutoff = 0.97). These tables were merged with a table of 16S rRNA gene amplicon studies downloaded from the Earth Microbiome Project (ftp://ftp.microbio.me/ emp/release1/otu_tables/closed_ref_greengenes/emp_ cr_gg_13_8.subset_5k.biom).

With the application of CD-HIT (v4.6) [42], these ORF sequences were further clustered under the criteria of 90% identity over the ORFs with > 90% coverage in the length of the sequences (> 250 bp). The clustered ORFs were aligned with existing ARGs (v1.1.1.A.fasta; https:// bench.cs.vt.edu/ftp/argminer/release/) and MGE data-bases (https://bench.cs.vt.edu/ftp/data/databases/) via DIAMOND (v2.0.9) by using the parameters of align-ment = 1, threshold value = 1e.10, identity > 70%, and query coverage > 50%. Metagenomic-assembled genomes with queried scaffolds that carried no less than one ARG-like gene were identified as potential antibiotic-resistant bacteria (PARB) [43].

Quantification of.metagenomes and.hosted ARGs,Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"The Quant_bin module of MetaWRAP (v1.3.2) was used to calculate the abundance of constructed genomes with default parameters [38]. Generally, read counts for the assembly of each sample were generated (with clean reads) using Salmon (v0.13.1) [44], which provided a relative abundance table (genome copies per million reads (ppm)) for each scaffold across differ-ent samples. For each genomic bin, the abundance of the containing contigs was summed and normalized to the total mapping read numbers in different samples (genome copies/ppm reads). To quantify the identi-fied ARG sequences located in each binning genome, Seqkit (v0.16.0), which was based on the DIAMOND output (query sequence information) files, was used in the study. The compiled sequences of the hospital and urban files were mapped to the extracted target genes using Bowtie2 (v2.3.5) with default parameters [45]. The generated SAM files were further processed using the built-in pipelines (pileup.sh) of BBmap (v38.87). The calculated average coverage folds were normalized to their sequencing size, and then were used to repre-sent the abundance of target genes [46].

"Clinical data on the HAI cases and consumption of antibiotic drugs during the sampling period were extracted from the monthly published reports, which were issued by the administrative department of the sampled hospital. Metagenomic sequencing data related to drinking water (PRJNA305188) were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnol-ogy Information (NCBI).

Previous studies have pointed out the bacterial phylogeny structures the resistome, which can be strengthened by anthropogenic influences [54C56]. In our sampled airborne PM2.5, some human commensal bacteria that are thought to have human (opportunistic) pathogenicity with AMR rel-evance, such as Enterobacteriaceae spp., Propionibac-terium spp., and Micrococcus aloeverae [57C59], varied substantially in abundance (Fig. S5), and contributed significantly to the hospital-specific differences (LefSe, log10(LDA score) = 0.1, P < 0.001) from urban sam-ples. The urban samples featured more environmentally prevalent bacteria, such as Ralstonia pickettii [60], over the two sampling seasons (Fig. S5).

"log10(genome copies/ppm reads)) than in urban ambient air (T-test, P < 0.001), especially during the summer (Fig..6a). As to the HVF-PARB that carried potentially mobile ARGs, they possessed significantly more resistant types (5.00  3.07 vs. 3.01  1.77, Fig..6a) in the hospital-specific  =PM2.5 (one-way ANOVA, F 11.0, P < 0.01) than in the urban (sampled in Guangzhou) ambient air",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt

As shown in Fig..6b, by using MetaCompare [47], the highest risk was identified in hospital PM2.5 as 25.60, which is the closest distance to the theoretical maximum AMR vertex in the risk ranking matrix, whereas the lowest score was found in the urban samples (17.70). Overall, the mean risk index score of the hospital",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"PM2.5 (21.17  2.08) was significantly higher than that of urban ones, but none of them exhibited seasonal differences (two-way ANOVA, Fsite = 12.7, Psite < 0.01, Pseason = 0.79). This indicates that antibiotic resistomes in the hospital samples were featured with higher abun-dance and HGT mobility and were hosted more by human pathogens than in urban air",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt

"PM2.5 sam-ples was probably caused by the lower input of AMR than from source-impacted locations [25, 30, 67], which may be partially explained by the lower human-associated bacteria input (Fig..1d), and/or by dilution through aerial transport from the sources of emission [68]. It should be noted that the AMR index merely differentiated all selected sites by a score of 3.5, but ARGs in hospital air PM2.5 more frequently co-occurred with MGEs and HVFs (z-axis values; T-test, P < 0.01, Fig..6b). This suggests that improvements need to be made to the resistome risk ranking method to more clearly label the AMR health hazards to human beings.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"To highlight the importance of PARB and to further explore their AMR risks, we calculated the concentra-tions of HFV-PARB that are pathogenic to human beings. The mean concentration in the hospital samples was 2.89  3.64 genome copies/m3-air (n = 19), which was around five times higher than in the urban ambient air PM2.5 (n = 10, SI-Additional file.1: Table.S7). This difference became more pronounced with the HVF-PARB that harbored mobile (MGE-associated) ARGs; there were an average of",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt

As such, an adult would inhale ~ 45 genome copies of HFV-PARB daily from the ambient air PM2.5 emitted from the sampled hospital (15 m3/day [10]; Fig..6c). This is generally consistent with the results of resistome risk estimations (Fig..6c), which indi-cate that the (Guangzhou) urban air PM2.5 had a lower AMR ranking index value than the hospital-emitted ones. Apart from inhalation, the ingestion of drinking water is another direct pathway of human exposure (2 L/day) to environmentally disseminated AMR [69, 70]. Of particu-lar interest is the finding that drinking water contained",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt

Hence, the daily intake of virulent antibi-otic-resistant bacteria via drinking water was 3.55  0.61 genome copies/day (n = 6; Fig..6b), which was nearly 10 times lower than that from the inhaled air PM2.5 in the study (Kruskal-Wallis test, 2 = 19.55, P < 0.001; n = 35). From the perspective of One.Health [5], this finding further suggests that the inhalation of air PM2.5, particu-larly that emitted from hospitals, may be an important AMR exposure pathway to human beings. However, due to the limitations regarding the geographical distri-bution of the PM2.5 samples collected from Guangzhou city (Southern China), a more holistic study remains to be conducted on the AMR hazards and risk rankings of source-specificair PM2.5.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
Conclusions,Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt
"The present study revealed a genome-resolved pano-rama of antibiotic resistomes in airborne PM2.5 in a typical municipal hospital and in urban ambient air. The hospital-specific resistome was significantly corre-lated with the dynamically varied structures of the bac-terial community (Procrustes test; permutations = 999, M2 = 0.39, P < 0.001)), to.which the human-associated microbiome (~ 30%). was the largest contributor. The patterns of occurrence of ARG-carrying bacteria in hos-pital airborne PM2.5 were potentially influenced by the incidence of -lactam HAIs in wards, highlighting a close relevance to the spread of AMR via PM2.5 from clinical sources to the surrounding air environments, especially in summer (Pearson; P < 0.05) when more precautions should be taken in air ventilation.disinfection procedures. Compared to urban ambient air samples, the higher abundance (twofold, P = 0.05), diversity, and mobility of ARGs carried by potentially virulent bacteria in hos-pital-specific PM2.5 (2.89  3.64 genome copies/m3-air) led to significantly more AMR hazards (MetaCompare index = 21.17  2.08, P < 0.01), to which humans could be exposed. It should be noted that the current study col-lected samples confining to one city in China. For better generalization of site-specific AMR features, compara-tive studies of airborne antibiotic resistomes and risk assessments encompassing hospitals (clinical) and other anthropogenic sources (e.g., landfills and wastewater treatment plants) across different geographical locations would be required. Our findings suggested that.ARG-car-rying bacteria in hospital airborne PM2.5 were potentially influenced by the incidence of HAIs in wards, while this AMR transmission chain (source C air C community) has yet to be systematically identified. As such, culture-based studies of source specific.airborne particles, especially on a larger geographical scale, are warranted to further examine the airborne-resistant pathogens associated with hospitals and the chains linking them to the devel-opment of AMR in the surrounding urban communities. Based on estimations of the intake of AMR materials, dif-ferences concerning human immunological responses to AMR exposure (respiration vs. digestion systems) should also be included in future risk assessments, particu-larly to compare multiple exposure pathways from the One.Health perspective.",Corpora/bio/RA8-M2022.txt

"Background: Gut microbiota contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis through microbes and their metabolites. The importance of microbiota-associated metabolites in colorectal carcinogenesis highlights the need to investigate the gut metabolome along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence to determine their mechanistic impli-cations in the pathogenesis of CRC. To date, how and which microbes and metabolites interactively promote early events of CRC development are still largely unclear.

"Results: We performed metabolomics and metagenomics profiling on fecal samples from 386 subjects including 118 CRC patients, 140 colorectal adenomas (CRA) patients and 128 healthy subjects as normal controls (NC). We identified differences in the gut metabolite profiles among NC, CRA and CRC groups by partial least squares-discriminant and principal component analyses. Among the altered metabolites, norvaline and myristic acid showed increasing trends from NC, through CRA, to CRC. CRC-associated metabolites were enriched in branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathways.

Introduction,Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health burden, with the gut microbiota identified as a key player in its development. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota alteration can drive carcino-genesis by promoting hyperproliferation of colonic cells. During their colonization and propagation, gut bacteria produce an array of metabolites, which have both direct and indirect influence on host metabolism and immune responses. It has also been proposed that perturbation of the gut microbiota can enhance the production of carci-nogenic products from damaging bacteria [1]. In particu-lar, gut microbiota and their metabolites were shown to induce epigenetic modifications of host cells [2], with the metabolites acting as crucial messengers in the crosstalk [3]. Fusobacterium nucleatum is a commonly reported CRC-enriched microbe that increases gene methylation and induces microsatellite instability [4, 5]. Trimeth-ylamine, mainly produced by Escherichia coli, induces DNA methylation [6] that is associated with CRC [7]. Bilophila wadsworthia and Pyramidobacter spp are other examples of CRC-enriched microbes, which reportedly enhanced carcinogenesis by producing genotoxic hydro-gen sulphide in the gut [8C11]. On the other hand, cer-tain gut bacteria such as Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium and Lactobacillus, can ferment dietary fibers to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are gut-protective and negatively associated with CRC. SCFAs including butyrate, propionate and acetate protect against CRC through mechanisms such as regu-lation of gut inflammation and immune system [12C14]. Butyrate and acetate can also act as inhibitors of histone deacetylase, thereby affecting the epigenetic modifica-tions controlling CRC development [15].",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"The importance of microbiota-associated metabo-lites in colorectal carcinogenesis highlights the need to investigate the gut metabolome along the adenoma-car-cinoma sequence to determine their mechanistic impli-cations in CRC pathogenesis. To date, only few studies have simultaneously performed gut metagenomics and metabolomics from same subjects in order to resolve the interplay between gut microbiota and metabolites in colorectal tumorigenesis [16C19]. It is still not clear how and which microbes and metabolites interactively pro-mote early events of CRC development.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"Here, we integrated the gut metabolome and micro-biota profiles of patients with CRC and colorectal ade-nomas (CRA) and compared them with those from healthy subjects. Our metabolite pathway enrichment and integrative analysis show that the gut metabolites and their association with gut microbiota were perturbed along colorectal carcinogenesis and that fecal metabolites can be utilized, in addition to bacteria, for non-invasive diagnosis of both CRA and CRC.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt

The average age of NC group was 64.03 years, 65.84 years for CRA group and 73.21 years for CRC group (Table S1). The distribution of gender and obesity among NC, CRA and CRC groups are shown in Table S1. All CRA and CRC subjects had intact colonic lesions at the time of stool collection. Stool samples were collected and stored at . 20 C within 4 h and at . 80 C within 24 h for long-term storage. Qiagen QIAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used for DNA extraction according to the manufacturers instructions. All patients provided writ-ten informed consent for participation in this study.

Metabolomics profiling,Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"In order to identify metabolites that might be playing active roles in the relationship among gut microbiota, metabolites and CRC, we targeted a panel of metabolites that were previously implicated in human gut micro-biota.host co-metabolism [20]. All samples were pro-vided for gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC-TOFMS) analysis using Micro-bioMET (Metabo-Profile, Shanghai, P. R. China), based on automated alkyl chloroformate derivatization. The GC-TOFMS system (Pegasus HT, Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MO) was operated in electron ionization (EI) mode and was used to quantify the microbial metabolites. The raw data generated by GC-TOFMS were processed using XploreMET v2.0, (a proprietary software by Metabo-Pro-file, Shanghai, P. R China) for automatic baseline denois-ing, smoothing, peak picking, and peak signal alignment. The baseline offset was set to one. Five points were aver-aged for peak smoothing. Compound identification was implemented by comparing both retention time and MS similarity with reference standards. Details of sample preparation, reference standards, instrumentation and metabolites profiling are provided in Supplementary methods.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
Metabolomics data analysis,Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
The metabolomics data analysis was conducted with R and online versions of MetaboAnalyst (http://www. metaboanalyst.ca) [21]. Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed using the R package mixOmics [22]. P values in both PCA and PLS-DA plot were calcu-lated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using distance matrices through the R package vegan [23]. Differential metabolites analysis were conducted using the R package MetaboAnalystR [24]. The significantly altered metabolites were determined by variable importance in projection (VIP) scores from pairwise PLS-DA analysis and pairwise comparisons using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate [25] (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparison. Metabolites with VIP score > 1 and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Interactions among disease associated metabolites were estimated by Spearmans rank correlation. Metabolite set enrich-ment analysis (MSEA) was performed using the online tool MetaboAnalyst. All heatmaps were drawn using the R package Complex Heatmap [26] The workflow for the metabolomics analysis is shown in Fig. S1.,Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt

The average bacterial species level read count per sample was 2,316,872 267,563. To reduce the effects of uneven sampling, the counts were rarefied to 1,947,705, the minimum read count of all samples. Bacte-rial taxa with < 20% prevalence were filtered out prior to downstream total sum scaling, differential abundance and biomarker selection analysis. Non-metric multidimen-sional scaling (NMDS) analysis was performed on Bray-Curtis distance from bacterial species abundances using the vegan R package.

A total of 97 metabolites were quantified from stool samples using GC-TOFMS. PLS-DA (Fig..1A) and PCA (Fig..1B) showed that there are differences in the gut metabolite profiles among CRC, CRA and NC groups (PERMANOVA, both p = 0.001), indicating a gut-metabolite shift in colon carcinogenesis.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"To identify significantly altered metabolites that may be important across the stages of CRC development, we performed pairwise comparisons between groups. When NC was compared with CRC, 17 metabolites were signifi-cantly altered. These include the enrichment of L-alanine, glycine, L-proline, L-aspartic acid, L-valine, L-leucine, L-serine, myristic acid, phenyl lactic acid, oxoglutaric acid, L-phenylalanine, L-alpha-aminobutyric acid, phe-nylacetic acid, palmitoleic acid, 3-aminoisobutanoic acid and norvaline. In contrast, butyric acid was depleted in CRC patients compared with NC (Fig..1C and Fig. S3A, Table S2). With the comparison of CRA with CRC, 36 metabolites were differentially abundant, including the depletion of 5-dodecenoic acid, linoleic acid, alpha-lino-lenic acid and butyric acid in CRC (Fig..1D and Fig. S3B, Table S3). Interestingly, L-alanine, glycine, L-proline, L-aspartic acid, L-valine, L-leucine, L-serine, myristic acid and phenyl lactic acid were enriched in CRC com-pared to both NC and CRA subjects (Fig..1C and D, Fig. S3). Moreover, norvaline and myristic acid were found to show increasing trends from NC, through CRA, to CRC (Fig. S4), suggesting their potential contribution to the progression of colon tumorigenesis.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"To gain insight into the functions of significantly altered metabolites for each paired group, we conducted MSEA. We observed differences in pathways associated with the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in stages leading to CRC. The top 4 enriched pathways in CRC compared with NC (Fig..1E) and CRA (Fig..1F) were (1) aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, (2) valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, (3) phenyla-lanine metabolism and (4) phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, indicating that metabolic path-ways are altered in addition to individual metabolites in colorectal carcinogenesis.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt

"We further explored the potential use of gut microbi-ome-associated metabolites for non-invasive diagno-sis of CRC. Using the identified significantly altered metabolites (Fig..1C and D), we built stepwise logistic regression models for the classifications of paired groups. Our model selected 20 metabolites as markers to clas-sify CRC from NC subjects, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 (Fig..2A). The same 20 markers distin-guished CRC from CRA with an AUC of 0.7889 (Fig..2B), and CRA from NC with an AUC of 0.661 (Fig..2C). To discriminate CRA from NC, 11 metabolites markers were identified with an AUC of 0.6853 (Fig..2D). These 11 metabolites markers classified CRA from CRC with an AUC of 0.7464 (Fig..2E), and CRC from NC with an AUC of 0.6764 (Fig..2F). CRC was classified from CRA by 13 metabolites markers with an AUC of 0.81 (Fig..2G). With these 13 markers, AUCs of 0.7168 and 0.6648 were obtained for CRC vs NC and CRA vs NC, respectively (Fig..2H and I). Moreover, adjusting clinical features, namely age, gender and obesity improved the perfor-mance of all markers with increases of about 8% in the AUCs (Fig. S5).

"To understand the potential interplay between signifi-cantly altered metabolites and differentially abundant bacterial species, we performed association analysis using ZINB regression. The distribution of associations was significantly different across the CRC stages (Fig. S12). Moreover, some associations followed an increas-ing or decreasing trend along CRC progression while some were reversed from negative to positive associa-tions (Fig. S13A) or vice versa (Fig. S13B). Among the 6 bacterial species discriminating CRC from NC, the asso-ciation between P. anaerobius and glycine was significant and increased along CRC progression (p < 0.05, Table S4), while the association between P. anaerobius and myristic acid was significant but decreased in CRC. P. micra was significantly associated with linoleic acid and L-valine and both associations followed decreasing trend from NC, through CRA, to CRC. Among the 14 bacterial markers discriminating CRA from NC, Clostridium sym-biosum was significantly correlated with CRC-enriched L-valine and L-homoserine and the strengths of both associations increased along CRC progression. Moreover, Synergistes sp. 3_1_syn1 was significantly associated with L-aspartic acid and L-tyrosine and both associations fol-lowed a decreasing trend. The correlations between Por-phyromonas gingivalis and gamma-aminobutyric acid as well as between Prevotella nigrescens and L-asparagine were also significant and decreased along CRC progres-sion (Table S4).",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"We further investigated the interactions among CRC-associated metabolites. The CRC-depleted metabolite butyric acid showed co-exclusive interactions with CRC-enriched metabolites including pimelic acid, L-proline, L-methionine, and L-isoleucine. Moreover, there were strong co-occurrence relationships (correlation coeffi-cient > 0.6 and p < 0.05) among CRC-enriched metabo-lites, such as L-proline, L-aspartic acid, L-methionine, oxoglutaric acid, L-leucine, L-valine, gamma-aminobu-tyric acid, L-isoleucine, L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine supporting their potential role in CRC (Fig. S14). Taken together, these results suggest that there are significant associations among gut metabolites and bacteria, which are changed along the stages of colorectal carcinogenesis.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
Discussion,Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"Accumulating evidence reveals that the gut microbiota and their metabolites play important roles in colorectal tumorigenesis. Here, we profiled the fecal metabolites and microbiome of CRC patients and compared them with those of precancerous CRA patients and healthy subjects. We demonstrated that key metabolic pathways were disrupted along CRC pathogenesis. Integrated metabolomic and microbiome analysis showed that inter-actions among CRC associated bacteria and metabolites are altered along the development of CRC. Importantly, we demonstrate a promising potential of fecal metabo-lites, in addition to bacteria, for non-invasive diagnosis of CRC.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"Metabolomics has the potential for diagnosis of cancer including CRC [16, 33]. Our metabolic profiling revealed that several amino acids, namely L-alanine, glycine, L-proline, L-aspartic acid, L-valine, L-leucine, L-serine, myristic acid and phenyl lactic acid were enriched in CRC patients compared to CRA and NC groups of sub-jects. Amino acids play important roles in several steps of molecular biosynthesis where they maintain redox bal-ance and serve as energy sources [34]. Abundant amino acids have also been reported to be crucial in driving the proliferation of cancer cells [35]. Derivatives of amino acids can affect immune responses and regulate epi-genetics. As such, they are reportedly associated with carcinogenesis [36]. Alanine, which was identified to be CRC-associated in this study, had been reported as an important survival signal in some gastrointestinal can-cers. For example, stromal cells secrete alanine required by the TCA cycle in promoting pancreatic cancer growth [37]. Additionally, glycine can provide essential precur-sors for the synthesis of nucleic acids, lipids and pro-teins, which support growth of cancer cells [38]. It was also reported that proline biosynthesis was upregulated and associated with poor prognosis of cancer [39], sup-porting our findings in this study. Interestingly, norvaline and myristic acid were found to show increasing trend from NC to CRA, and to CRC. Norvaline is an isomer of valine, which was implicated in the cytotoxic activity of macrophages against breast tumor cells [40]. Norvaline also reportedly promotes tissue regeneration and muscle growth partially by the inhibition of ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 [41]. Myristic acid is a common unsat-urated fatty acid positively associated with high choles-terol levels in human and reported to increase the risk of breast cancer development [42]. The increasing trend of these two metabolites along CRC development hints at their potential roles in colorectal tumorigenesis and war-rants further investigation. The only metabolite depleted in CRC patients in this study is butyric acid, a short chain fatty acid produced by fermentation of dietary fibers in the large bowel. It has been consistently demonstrated that butyric acid has a protective effect against colorectal cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apop-tosis [43], further supporting our discovery in this study.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"Pathway enrichment analysis showed that aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, aromatic amino acids biosynthesis and BCAAs metabolisms were altered in CRC patients and adenoma patients compared with healthy subjects. Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis needs aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, an important class of enzymes with an evo-lutionarily conserved mechanism for protein synthesis, some of which show positive associations with colorectal tumor development [44]. BCAAs including valine, leu-cine and isoleucine were CRC-upregulated in this study compared to CRA and healthy subjects. They are essen-tial nutrients for cancer growth and are used by tumors in various biosynthetic pathways and as sources of energy [45]. Moreover, gut microbes were observed to play active roles in the metabolism of aromatic amino acids including tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan [46]. Modulation of the serum level of aromatic amino acids was shown to impair both intestinal permeability and systemic immunity in gnotobiotic mice [46]. This sug-gests that dysregulation of aromatic amino acid biosyn-thesis observed in this study may induce CRC through an impaired gut barrier. Also, tryptophan metabolism was reportedly implicated in therapy against gastrointestinal disorders through the host-gut microbiota interface [47]. Phenylalanine, found upregulated in CRC patients in this study, is an essential amino acid, which may contribute to proliferation and migration of cancer cells [48]. Our dis-covery, supported by previous reports [16, 49] show that BCAAs, aromatic amino acids and phenylalanine metab-olomic pathways may play important roles in colorectal carcinogenesis.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"We further explored the potential use of gut microbi-ome associated metabolites in non-invasive diagnosis of CRC. CRC was classified from NC and from CRA with 20 and 13 metabolite markers, respectively, each with an AUC of about 0.80. Six bacterial species distinguished CRC from NC and CRA with an AUC of 0.91 and 0.89 respectively. With the combination of metabolites and bacterial markers, a higher discriminating power demon-strated by an AUC of 0.94 was achieved with 11 metabo-lites and 6 bacterial species including F. nucleatum, P. anaerobius, P. micra, R. inulinivorans, E. corrodens and X. perforans. Interestingly, we observed that a combination of 4 metabolites namely alpha linoleic acid, L-homoser-ine, phenyl lactic acid and phenyl acetic acid, and bacteria markers including F. nucleatum, P. anaerobius, P. micra,",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"R. inulinivorans, E. corrodens and X. perforans classified CRA from NC, with an AUC of 0.7499 demonstrating the potential for early diagnosis of colorectal adenoma from healthy patients.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"Moreover, our association analysis revealed that the relationships among metabolites and bacteria were sig-nificantly different in CRC patients compared with NC and CRA subjects. While some associations followed increasing or decreasing trends along CRC progression, some were reversed from negative to positive and vice versa. Notable is the increased correlations between glycine, reported to support cancer cell growth [38], and P. anaerobius that drives CRC via the PI3K-Akt-NF-B signaling pathway [49], suggesting a potential cooperation between glycine and P. anaerobius in the development of CRC. In addition, Clostridium sym-biosum, which was found to increase in abundance from the colon tissues of healthy subjects to adenoma patients and finally to colonic cancer patients [50], was significantly correlated with CRC-enriched metabolites L-valine and L-homoserine, with increased strengths along CRC progression. Collectively, these results indicate significant interplays among gut metabo-lites and bacteria, which might influence colorectal carcinogenesis.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"The microbial related metabolites reported in this study were based on metabolomics data and chemical proper-ties of human microbiome associated metabolites [20, 51]. Automated alkyl chloroformate derivatization method was used for the GC-TOF/MS detection [20]. The GC-MS response was poor for bile acids due to their strong polar-ity. New methods have recently been developed for the specific detection of bile acids [52], and its association with CRC will be examined in the future study.",Corpora/bio/RA9-Microbiome2022.txt
"In conclusion, our integrated metabolites and microbi-ome study demonstrates that gut metabolites along with the microbiome are altered along stages of colorectal carcino-genesis and that the combination of metabolites and bacte-rial taxa can increase the chance of non-invasive diagnosis of colorectal cancer and adenoma.

Introduction,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"It has been widely predicted that global climate change will affect biodiversity [1–3], species",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"distribution and population growth [4–6]. Forests, as indispensable resources on Earth, have",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"tremendous ecological, economic, social, and aesthetic value. Tree species distribution and forest composition will undergo substantial shifts in the future [7–11]. Changes in forest community composition may exert impacts on net primary productivity and carbon storage [12, 13].",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
It is essential to determine how climate factors influence forest population growth and community composition [14].,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"Average population growth rates are usually expected to be stable, but patterns of variation",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
in population growth rates are different for different species. Variation in population growth,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"rates is related to species birth, growth, reproduction and death [8, 15–17]. A recent study considered forest population dynamics, particularly the rate at which forest distributions might",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"shift under climate change [6]. Change in a forest community is related to species-specific responses of the tree species in that community to climate change. In terms of population dynamics, dominant species respond differently to changing environmental conditions [18, 19],",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"thereby giving rise to a change in community composition. For instance, Feeley et al. (2007)",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"[20] found a widespread decrease in tree growth rates for species occurring in large forested dynamic plots at Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), and the changes in growth were significantly associated with regional climate changes. Not long after, the authors revealed that, in",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"this same plot, there have been consistent, directional changes in the tree species composition",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"towards a significantly greater representation of species with greater drought tolerance, which",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
was consistent with long-term climate change [21]. Declines of population growth rates were,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"found in other studies, and these declines were usually climate-correlated [22]. Furthermore,",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
traditional analyses usually assume that tree species composition or population growth rate is,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"constant and fail to capture the temporal dynamics of these factors, making it difficult to attribute the change to environmental conditions [20, 22]. Thus, quantifying the temporal growth",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
dynamics of population in the context of community change when the influences of climate,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
variations are of interest is necessary.,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
Tropical and subtropical forests are major biodiversity hotspots harbouring many species and,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"are recognised as important global carbon sinks and sources [18, 19, 23–25]. Long-term directional changes in the community composition of tropical forests have been reported recently, and",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"these changes have been attributed to climate change [21, 26]. Studies have analysed the effects of",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"climate change on the composition of various plant communities in many areas, including deserts",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"[27], grasslands [28]and lowland forests [29]. Actually, climate-driven impacts on long-term community changes are difficult to disentangle from changes driven by stand development [30]. Although, the causes underlying these changes, specifically the contribution of long-term climate",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"change vs. successional recovery from past disturbances, remain debated [21]. To increase the accuracy and reliability of the assessment, the community development process should be considered when one examines the effects of climate change on community composition change.",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
"To understand the effects of temporal environmental changes on community composition,",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
it is important to identify the rates at which species have already responded to recent climate,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt

"change. To better understand the dynamics of community composition in a changing world, it",Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
is necessary to quantify community composition change rate.,Corpora/bio/Xiao-Yu Chang et al. (2015).txt
